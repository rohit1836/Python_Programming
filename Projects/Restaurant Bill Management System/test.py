Introduction
You have just decided to take in an incredibly useful bit of information that has
the capacity to change your life for the better! While it may still sound like a
foreign language at this point, by downloading this book, kundalini awakening
has become a future that lies within your grasp.
Thank you for choosing this book among all the others on this topic. There are
plenty of books about the kundalini and its effects on the body, mind, and soul,
but you chose this one, and for that, I’m grateful. Thank you.
In the following pages, expect to be guided by lists based on big kundalini ideas,
such as awakening myths and dispelling them, benefits to the process of
awakening, techniques to guide your approach, dangers and potential risks, most
common mistakes, general steps to success, and then even more metaphysical
connections in the final chapter.
In the first chapter, I’ll lead you through the basics of the kundalini, such as what
it is, how it relates to the chakras, what you can do with it, and some frequently
asked questions. In the second chapter, we’ll get into those bigger lists with
benefits to awakening, myths about the process, and signs that you’re
awakening. Following that, the third chapter teaches awakening techniques and
additional practices that can help.
In the fourth chapter, we’ll troubleshoot your awakening with potential things,
people, situations, etc., that could be holding you back, as well as the potential
dangers and risks, and the biggest mistakes people have made (and how to avoid
them). In the fifth and final chapter, I’ll lead you through a so-called kundalini
“master class,” with details about chakra healing and alignment and a guide to
reaching higher planes of consciousness, to astral projection and traveling, and
to unlocking your psychic gifts.
While the kundalini and its awakening should not necessarily be focused on
what you can gain (especially in material or psychic terms) from the process, it
is still helpful to know all that you’re getting yourself into and all that could
potentially exist once the kundalini is awakened.
Chapter 1: Introduction to the Kundalini
Before we get into the details of kundalini and its awakening, we should first
become familiar with our terms. You’ll need to know exactly what kundalini is
and why it’s so important in order for the later chapters of this book to make
sense. You’ll need to learn the basics of your chakras also, to understand how
kundalini awakening practices overlap with and influence chakra healing. As
this chapter progresses, we’ll start with the history of kundalini before getting
into its applications for the chakras, for overall healing, and for your life in
general. Buckle up for the ride.
The History of Kundalini
Around the time 3,000 BC, ancient Indians were beginning to speak and write
about kundalini. “Little coiled one” is what it meant to them in their language,
Sanskrit, but it meant a lot more than just the image of a little snake residing at
the base of one’s spine. To these ancient Indians, kundalini was their connection
to the sacred and divine energy of the universe and of creation itself. They called
that source or creation energy prana, and prana-shakti (or shakti) was how it
manifested in lifeforms like humans and animals on earth.
For humans, shakti lies at the base of the spine, infusing the body, mind, and
soul of the individual with life and passion and verve. Kundalini is a vehicle for
spreading shakti throughout the body, and when kundalini – that small coiled
snake that sleeps at the base of all our spines – is awakened, it will make the
individual a vessel for source energy in a myriad of ways. While this original
practice and acknowledgment of kundalini was not attached to any religion or
dogma in particular, it was attached to ancient Indian spiritual tradition and
became linked with its gods and goddesses to a certain degree.
Kundalini didn’t just exist in ancient India, however, which is absolutely
fascinating to me. With different names and different gods and goddesses
attached to its understanding, kundalini also existed in ancient Egyptian
civilizations. Have you ever wondered what the ankh symbol represents in
Egyptian symbology and history? Essentially, it signifies the coming together of
masculinity and femininity, the divine male and female energy, for the purpose
of creation (or source recreation).
Egyptian rulers would then carry the ankh as a talisman of spirituality and
alignment with source potential in their day-to-day rulings and other actions. In
ancient Indian culture, too, kundalini was symbolized by the lingam-yoni,
another combination of masculine and feminine energies in physical form. This
similarity and more reveal that these two ancient cultures were on the same page
about a force so intense and impactful.
Then, there is ancient China, where the concept of chi arises, bearing incredible
resemblance to prana, shakti, and kundalini awakening in India. Once again,
however, the wording is totally different from country to country – it’s what
they’re talking about that’s so fascinatingly the same. For these ancient Chinese
people, chi was essentially the life or source energy that exists within all of us,
but not many of us are very in control of this energy.
Chi can affect the health and one’s physical energy level generally, but when it’s
aligned with sexuality, chi can do even more unbelievable things. Just as
kundalini-oriented sexual practices focus on the reversal of orgasm energy (see
Chapter 3 for more details) to the crown rather than out one’s base, ancient
Chinese people knew that sending orgasm energy back to the brain could
lengthen life, reverse the effects of aging, and more. This awareness of a central
channel inside the body that directs energy from place to place also harkens
kundalini from ancient Indian culture, too.
Kundalini arises again in world history with the onset of alchemy as a practice in
the Middle Ages. Once more, with different names and terminology, kundalini
came to the people through a practice in which the followers claimed they were
learning it so they could turn base metals into gold. The real purpose was a little
more complicated. These alchemists were really just working on spiritual
awakening. And the story about turning base metals into gold? That was really
more of a metaphor about the personality practice they were engaging in to find
a more spiritual self-alignment.
Alchemy is a fascinating topic to explore for the more and more details you
learn, the more and more it almost explicitly overlaps with kundalini
appreciation in Indian tradition. In sum, the basic tools used in alchemy correlate
to different ways one can unlock his or her central channel for the sake of selfbetterment (enlightenment, awakening, psychic powers, and more), like what the
ancient Chinese were referencing with orgasm reversal.
Aside from these other world examples, though, kundalini only retained the
same name and the exact same details in its country of origin, and all the while
in ancient India, kundalini awareness was also backed by the practice of yoga.
Physical movement and meditation were equally important to get that small
coiled snake to uncoil and get going.
When one Indian yogi, Yogi Bhajan, brought kundalini yoga to California in the
United States in the 1960s, his practice focused on expanded consciousness
without drugs and with some hearty and real spiritualism instead. Yogi Bhajan
taught a method of yoga that focused on discipline and bodily awakening for the
sake of the true self, and this action created a rapid-fire awareness of kundalini
that continues to the present day.
What is “Kundalini” All About, Exactly?
Kundalini is, first of all, a metaphor for the energy flow in our bodies. The word
means “little coiled one,” and it describes a snake that lies asleep at the base of
our spine that’s somehow filled with godly and god-like energy. The serpent or
snake sleeps there and waits to act as a vehicle for divinity in our bodies and
lives. As awakening happens, the snake begins to wake up, uncoil, and move
throughout our bodies like it’s swimming through a placid lake. Blockages in the
body are then processed and dissolved. Irritations and personality quirks melt
away. Emotional expression becomes easier and easier. With the energy of
creation flowing through us, things become easier, and we become transcendent
in a number of ways. So, on one hand, kundalini will always be about how
divine energy can flow within our bodies with the right effort and practice.
Secondly, kundalini is a practice of being in the world that focuses on your
soul’s awakening to truth. Kundalini awareness–whether boosted through
meditation, physical exercise, yoga, music, art, forgiveness, conversations, big
life events, or otherwise–helps you learn to hear and channel your own truth
better. It can help you gain insight during times of need, it can help you feel less
alone, it can help you find your direction in life, and so much more. All you have
to do is get in touch with yourself through a variety of techniques and then open
yourself to your own inner potential. Kundalini will do the rest.
Third, kundalini is an image that the ancient Indian people created to express
what they felt about divinity. For them, kundalini was about the potential that
rests within us. It was about the fact that we all have source energy–divinity–
inside of us that can be awakened with the right combination of awareness,
practice, focus, and effort. In every culture kundalini existed in, no matter what
it was called, it was used as a way to connect with the gods of the time; it was
always a way to unlock and harness psychic potential and learn from godly
examples. Basically, kundalini was one way these ancient people found proof of
their gods, but at the same time, kundalini also taught them that true “god”
would never require a dogma in order to be appreciated and boosted in one’s
life. For us today, kundalini is similar in that it teaches us our godly potential
while denying the need for a cult of worship. Kundalini is simply there, and as it
awakens, it demonstrates our connection with life, with the divine, and with the
entire rest of humanity.
Finally, kundalini is about healing on all levels. Across time, kundalini
awareness and awakening have been tied up with healing attempts. Ancient
Chinese people, along with Medieval and Renaissance alchemists, were surely
using their versions of “kundalini” to try to make themselves better. Ancient
Egyptian rulers carried their ankhs to help solidify and strengthen their power,
effectively “healing” their rulership capabilities. Ancient Indians, too, were
working on healing themselves and one another through the kundalini’s central
channel. No matter what culture the message surfaces from, it seems to be the
same: with increased awareness of the energy systems in the body, we can learn
to reverse maladaptive processes and instigate deeper, lasting healing.
Chakras & the Kundalini
One of the easiest ways to think of the kundalini is to think of it in terms of your
chakras. The kundalini obviously deals with inner movement, healing and
divinity, but it can be confusing to see how that all actually happens for you,
your healing, and your body when it’s not visible and only explained through the
metaphor of a rising serpent. Let’s take a step back and start from scratch with
your understanding here, and I think you’ll be able to work it out better in no
time.
Imagine that there are seven energetic “centers” in your body, all aligned at
different spots on your spine. At each of these centers, energy flows from one
point onto the next, but sometimes, things get a little stuck. Some centers close
up after you experience trauma or get in a fight, while other centers might start
moving energy in the wrong direction, affecting the overall flow of this intricate
system for the worst. Sometimes, just a bad day or a misplaced personality trait
can get things working far from their best in those centers.
Now, imagine that these seven energetic centers are also connected with seven
respective and important glands for your body that keep it (and you) running in
ship-shape. These centers are essentially your chakras. The whole situation I’ve
just described is real, and the worst can absolutely happen to you. Enter:
kundalini awakening. When you come to a time in your life when you’re ready
to begin a spiritual awakening, those blockages and flow stoppers will be much
bigger problems than you may have thought they were. You’ll come to realize
that they’re embodied in your chakras, and it’ll be up to you to dig out the
poison.
Those seven energetic centers linked to glands are indeed called your chakras,
and we can walk through them so that you have a better understanding as we
move forward. Of those seven chakras or “energy wheels,” each one associates
with a different color, part of the body, energy of healing, and more.
First, we’ll start with the root chakra. The root chakra is located on the base of
the spine where kundalini and shakti rest. The root chakra is also called
Muladhara, and it links with the color red, affecting areas of your life that deal
with survival, security, safety, sexuality, and groundedness. Furthermore, this
chakra relates to healing the reproductive organs, the legs, and the feet.
The second chakra is the sacral chakra, and it’s located just a few inches below
your belly button. The sacral chakra is also called Svadhishthana, and it links
with the color orange, affecting areas of your life that deal with creativity,
originality, community, trust, pleasure, and movement. This chakra has the
healing capacity for the intestines, the ovaries, and the body’s detoxification
system.
The third chakra is the solar plexus chakra, and it’s located a few inches above
the navel, around the diaphragm where the ribcage comes together in the lower
chest. The solar plexus chakra is also called Manipura, and it links with the color
yellow, affecting areas of our lives that deal with confidence, willpower,
assertiveness, dominance, need for control, communicating one’s truth, and
feeling brave. Furthermore, this chakra heals ailments related to digestion,
anxiety, self-worth, and the body’s detoxification system.
The fourth chakra is the heart chakra, and it’s located directly where you’d think
it would be: at the heart. It’s also called Anahata, and it links with the color
green, affecting areas of your life that deal with love, compassion, joy,
interpersonal warmth, selflessness, and family or partnership. In addition, this
chakra heals ailments of the circulatory, respiratory, and skeletal systems.
The fifth chakra is the throat’s chakra, and it lies in the throat, as you’d expect.
It’s also called Vishuddha, and its color is blue. It affects areas of your life that
deal with communication, vocalization, truth, sharing, supporting, and
purification. It can even heal ailments related to respiration, skeletal health, and
ingestion.
The sixth chakra is the third eye chakra, and it rests in between one’s brows. It’s
also called Ajna, and it links with the color indigo, affecting areas of your life
that deal with insight, intuition, literal and metaphorical sight, guidance,
perception of reality, manifestation, and overall mentality. Furthermore, this
chakra contains healing capacity for one’s vision, intellect, brain, skin, and
hearing.
The seventh and final chakra contained within one’s physical body is the crown
chakra, and it rests at the tip of one’s head. It’s called Sahasrara, and its
respective color is a loud and vibrant purple. This chakra affects one’s psychic
abilities, spirituality, connection with divinity, sense of purpose and mission,
direction in life, and consciousness of the cosmic reality. This chakra also heals
issues that relate to the brain, skin, and hair growth.
Now, with all seven of these chakras spinning in the right direction with no
blockages whatsoever, your kundalini would be unable to help itself from rising
into that state of bliss it perceives up above. Ultimately then, the goal, as one
gets ready for kundalini awakening, is to help clear, open, and align those
chakras. With the greatest ease of motion achieved, kundalini will respond and
demonstrate how well it knows what to do.
As you begin to work through blockages or energetic reversals of these chakras,
you may find that those struggles look something like this. For the root chakra,
blockages might look like low energy, general fear, constant fatigue, identity
crisis, feeling disconnected from the world, eating disorders, general loss or
inconsistent of appetite, overt materialism, trouble saving money, or constant
health problems in general.
For the sacral chakra, blockages or reversals might look like lack of creativity,
lack of inspiration, low or no motivation, low or no sexual appetite, feelings of
unimportance, feelings of being unloved, feelings of being unaccepted, feelings
of being the outcast, inability to care for oneself, or consistent and repeated
relationship problems with one’s intimate partners.
For the solar plexus chakra, blockages might look like identity crises or deficits,
low self-esteem, low or no self-worth, digestive issues, food intolerances, poor
willpower, constant tiredness, constant nausea, anxiety disorders, liver disorder
or disease, frequent infections, lack of core strength, lack of overall strength,
consistent depression with little release, feelings of being betrayed, feelings of
being rejected, feelings of being replaced, or excessive energy.
For the heart chakra, reversals and blockages might look like the inability to love
oneself or others, inability to put others first, inability to put yourself first,
inability to get over a problematic ex, constantly holding onto grudges, trust
issues, social anxiety or intense shyness, inability to express emotions in a
healthy way, problems with commitment, constant procrastination, intense
anxiety, or the inability to make or keep friends.
For the throat chakra, blockages might look like oversharing, inability to speak
truthfully, inability to communicate with others, literal laryngitis, sore throats,
breathing or airway restrictions, asthma, anemia, constant fatigue, inability to
find the right words, paralyzing fear of being misunderstood, nervousness in
public situations, occasional intense dizziness, verbal submissiveness, verbal
dominance, or conflict avoidance.
For the third eye chakra, blockages or reversals might look like lack of direction
in life, increasingly intense feelings of boredom or stagnancy, migraines,
insomnia, eye or vision problems, depression, high blood pressure, inability to
recall one’s dreams, constant and jarring flashbacks, closed-mindedness,
paranoia, history of mental disorders, history of addiction, lack of feeling
connected to the world and nature and others, cynicism, constant irritation, or
uncontrollable acne breakouts.
For the crown chakra, blockages might look like feelings of greed, intense
depression, need for dominance over others, self-destructive behaviors, history
of addiction, generally destructive behaviors, dissociations from the physical
plane, inability to make even the simplest decisions, constant fatigue, horrible
migraines, hair loss, anemia, cognitive fog, poor mental function, lack of
intellectual abilities, or feeling unworthy of divinity, god, or creation.
What to Do with Your Kundalini
Now that you know all these details about the chakras, you can start to
understand what to do with your kundalini. Once these blockages and energetic
reversals are corrected and worked through, you can use the kundalini to align
and open the chakras even more than you could do consciously. You can bring
kundalini to the game with no holding back and make sure things get opened up
from the inside out.
Aside from chakras, however, you can use kundalini for so much more. “Using”
kundalini feels so wrong to say, but you get the gist. There are things that can be
strengthened by adding kundalini to the mix, and there are things that you’d
never experience if it wasn’t for your connection to shakti through that kundalini
serpent. As you approach kundalini awakening, keep the following possibilities
under consideration, for there are many potential goals in the awakening process,
and it’s up to you to decide what you think you can handle.
To start, you can simply become increasingly aware of your kundalini through
meditation on shakti and prana. Even before you reach a stage where you’re
approaching awakening (or knee-deep in it), you can become aware of so much
more in your body, in others, and in the world by meditating on the source
energy and directing that insight toward kundalini. Your efforts, in this case, will
help establish a base of potential for energetic work later on.
You can become more conscious of kundalini by using it to instigate your
awakening or by letting it happen naturally. If you’re interested in speeding up
the process, consider any of the techniques listed in Chapter 3. If you’re more
interested in taking things naturally (and thereby, a bit more slowly), simply start
meditating. Try to incorporate daily meditation practice into your life, or if you
already do yoga, start adding a longer meditation segment to the end of your
yoga practice when you do so. When you meditate, you can either work to
silence your thoughts and connect with that calm, still space within, or you can
meditate on kundalini itself and its potential in order to start doing that important
kundalini work in the world.
You can apply kundalini to the work of developing your psychic abilities, which
have always already been a part of you. One side effect of kundalini awakening
is that you’ll become more connected than ever to your psychic abilities, and
yes, I used the plural “abilities” on purpose. You’ll have to get used to thinking
of psychic-ness as something natural instead of supernatural. It’s not crazy to
think of yourself as psychic, much less with psychic abilities. In truth, humans
are innately psychic creatures, and each of us has a variety of psychic gifts to
unlock with time and patience. It won’t be just one thing; it will be a
combination of gifts that intertwine and add context or direction to your soul
mission in life. How you choose to use those gifts is up to you, but if you’re at
the point of kundalini awakening when you receive them, you’ll surely want to
align your use of those gifts with your highest possible potential.
You can experience mystical connection and enlightenment through kundalini
awakening, too. As you work through your chakras and get to the crown, you
should be feeling a whole new connection with divinity. Your kundalini will
then begin to move and churn through your energy centers, and things will
change once again. You may find that you experience inexplicable bliss,
personality trait shifts, connection with spirit guides and guardians, the release of
old fears, and more as you get to this point with awakening, but your intellect
won’t be boggled or left behind; it’ll be along for the ride. Remember that you
don’t have to intentionally use kundalini for this end for it will happen as a
symptom of your awakening regardless.
You can even heal yourself and others with the power of shakti flowing freely
through you. Whether you choose to use this power for yourself or others, too,
that is up to you, but for now, know that you will become gifted with healing
capacity as your kundalini awakening proceeds. Your body will begin to
naturally heal itself, and even your cells will become replenished and repaired in
ways you may never have imagined were possible. While the adjustment to
kundalini awakening will be rough and there will be period(s) of detoxification,
once you get into the process, you will find that you feel better than ever and
ready to take on the world.
You can live more authentically. With your kundalini active and engaged, you’ll
feel more confident, brave, worthy, and inspired to act out your soul mission in
the world, and you won’t be able to handle the expression of inauthentic
emotions (whether from yourself or others). As you align with awakening,
godliness, and divinity, you additionally settle yourself in the camp of the
genuine, the authentic, and the honest. You will want to support the people you
love, and you will want to provide service to others you know really need it.
You’ll become more conscious of how the system around you works, so you’ll
be picky and cautious about where you spend your money. Overall, you’ll be
able to live a fuller, more hectic life, but it will also be so much more rewarding
once you get there and allow the experiences to flow.
As a final point for now, you can also direct kundalini energy toward any goal,
whether manifestation, healing, attraction, or otherwise. When it comes down to
it, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a single thing that can’t be strengthened or
adapted for the better with kundalini awakening behind it. You’ll be able to
harness your focus toward any means, any dream, and any goal. You’ll be able
to put plans in motion that have only been passing thoughts until now. You’ll
understand yourself and the world better than ever before, enabling you to act in
it in ways that attract exactly what you want. Think of yourself as a powerful
magnet, drawing to you whatever you need, and that’s essentially what you can
expect. Get ready for the adventure! Awakening is going to be a wild experience
for us all.
Frequently Asked Questions
“Tl;dr” version coming your way! If you’d rather just skip to the basics, this
section has it all packed into one place, but if you’ve ended up here because you
still read books chapter by chapter sequentially, this section may be a bit of a
recap, although it may still help to hone the information you’ve been taking in so
far. Overall, you’re in for some focused and purposeful information sharing
before we move on to the juicier details of kundalini, awakening benefits,
relevant awakening techniques, and more.
What is kundalini?
When it comes down to it, kundalini is a vessel for shakti–universal, cosmic,
divine, godly, goddess energy–to flow in the human body. For some realms of
study, kundalini actually is the goddess or goddess energy of the universe
manifested in our bodies, for it is what inspires artistic creation and reproductive
procreation in the human realm. Regardless, kundalini is the inward example of
all that is too big for us to understand, and when it’s activated, it can provide the
most incredible experiences (and life in general) for the practitioner.
What is kundalini yoga?
Kundalini yoga is a practice brought to the United States (and the West in
general) in the 1960s by a practitioner named Yogi Bhajan. He wanted to share
with these drug-using, countercultural hippies of America how to really reach
spiritual “highs.” His version of enlightenment didn’t require drugs, rock and
roll, or travel. Yogi Bhajan’s method was kundalini awakening as focused
through yoga. Basically, the movement of the body through yoga helps to work
out blockages and increase the flow of the kundalini, so this guided meditation
preaches an ability to perform what all those kids using psychedelics were trying
to do, but better.
How does kundalini yoga tie into kundalini
awakening?
Kundalini yoga ties in directly to kundalini awakening. Awakening cannot truly
take place without the practice of something physical to make sure that the body
and mind are balanced, and kundalini yoga is the perfect tie-in to kundalini
awakening in this sense. If you can find a local yoga studio that offers kundalini
yoga, take them up on it! It is a wonderful guide into the experience of
enlightenment.
What should I expect from my kundalini awakening?
For more details, you can check out Chapter 2 to see the different elements of
what to expect and Chapter 4 for worst-case scenarios and ways to troubleshoot
the experience. However, you can also find a general answer in the next few
sentences. As you begin the process of kundalini awakening (i.e., meditation,
yoga, introspection, self-and-world-analysis, and more), you will find yourself
buzzing. You’ll experience more synchronicities than ever before, and you may
find yourself additionally guided to work through or process old wounds
emotionally and physically. As you fully engage with awakening, there will be a
detoxification period in which you’re cranky, you smell, and the last thing you
want to do is meditate. Work through it! Bust through this phase, and on the
other side, you’ll experience the symptoms of full-fledged kundalini activation
and more. Expect health, excitement, connectivity to the universe and divinity,
hope, less depression, healthier eating, guidance, synchronicities, and love
coming to you from every corner of your life.
Is kundalini, shakti, prana, chi, qi, and reiki all
talking about the same thing?
Essentially, yes. Kundalini is one expression of shakti, which is the same thing
as prana, qi, chi, and reiki. These terms are all talking about the intrinsic,
creative, source energy of the universe. The positive and negative, the dark and
the light, the attraction and loss, the creation and destruction–the opposites of
existence as we live and breathe them on a daily basis--are this source energy;
we just live in the midst of it.
Will this experience be dramatic or subtle?
Uncomfortable or easy? Painful or painless?
At the start of your kundalini process, depending on what chakra blockages, old
wounds, and traumas you have to work through to reach an awakening vibration,
things may be dramatic and painful. But if you remain determined and keep
focus, you will work through those feelings and dramatic times to reach a
peaceful and stable future space that’s fully aligned with enlightenment. On the
other hand, awakening will be uncomfortable, at times, for everyone. That’s
unavoidabl, but being uncomfortable once in a while is a good thing! It keeps us
on our toes, and it enables us to relearn our boundaries, for they do happen to
change as we grow and heal. Kundalini awakening teaches us to learn from these
so-called “negative experiences” of discomfort, drama, and pain so that we can
see how they shape us and what they ultimately teach us about ourselves and
humanity as a whole.
What will I get out of it?
First of all, this type of thinking isn’t necessarily aligned with the vibration of
enlightenment or awakening. If you’re coming at the opportunity skeptically yet
looking immediately to get something out of the experience, I’m not even sure
your thinking is aligned with itself. If you’re skeptical, try it out and see what
happens! What have you got to lose? If you’re not skeptical but a believer
looking for gains, try meditating on kundalini awakening as a potential for you
and see if you’re guided in any way. It could honestly be that kundalini
awakening isn’t right for you at this time, but if you truly believe it is, hear this
and ponder away: you will get as much out of it as you put into it.
Do I need a guru/guardian/healer/teacher for this type
of work?
Short answer: No, you do not. Longer answer: Anyone could benefit from a
teacher, but you don’t necessarily need one for this endeavor. Your own
connection to yourself, your guides, and your kundalini can be all that you need
to succeed in terms of awakening. There are also a plethora of websites to skim
through when seeking advice, and Chapter 4 of this book also provides
troubleshooting tactics for when you need some guidance. However, if you
happen upon a teacher or guru, see where that relationship takes you! Never turn
down such a gorgeous serendipity.
How do you awaken the kundalini?
There are a number of different techniques you can use to start things up and
speed things along, and those methods can be found in Chapter 3, but until you
get there, here’s a brief guide. First, you begin meditating and practicing yoga
(or other light physical exercise). Then, you might change your diet to be
healthier or for higher vibration. Then, you might have a plethora of other
changes that you want to make in your life as your daily routine becomes more
complex and oriented toward health. Eventually, in meditation, you will feel
clear and open, and the kundalini will begin to rise. This marks the beginning of
awakening, and you will be set on your path.
What are the health benefits of kundalini awakening?
A number of health benefits can be found in Chapter 2, but for now, it will
suffice to know that kundalini awakening can trigger a number of healing
patterns. It can help repair cells and trigger autophagy. It can heal injuries
(emotional and physical in nature), it increases mental health and emotional
stability, it can heal the immune system, it can help with respiratory function, it
works for the heart, and it can do so much more.
If I’m practicing another religion, should I try to
awaken myself in this way or is it too much?
Kundalini awakening will not interfere with your religious practice. You can
easily overlap your faith onto the practice of awakening. If you need to, you can
call shakti something else that aligns with your God. If you can’t call it
meditating, call it “thinking things out.” If you can’t call it yoga, call it
“stretching.” Adapt things as needed and allow them to mesh together. You can
absolutely keep working on awakening no matter what truth you believe in.
Will kundalini awakening be in conflict with my other
methods of searching for spiritual enlightenment?
I guess it depends on what other methods you’re using! However, the answer for
the most part is no. Kundalini awakening shouldn’t be in conflict with your other
methods; in fact, it should strengthen your overall search for enlightenment
because kundalini awakening is so needless of dogma or religion to back it up. It
can exist without faith, and it can be combined so easily with many other
spiritual expressions. Surely, it will only bolster your other methods, and it will
be fascinating to see how they all work together to help your divine truth.
Is forcing the kundalini awake a bad move?
Yes. You don’t want to explicitly force the kundalini to do anything. Even
instigating your awakening can be too much for some people, so I always,
always recommend that people start slowly with the process to ensure that they
don’t hurt themselves (energetically, physically, emotionally, and/or mentally).
Begin by just meditating daily for a week or so and adding in yoga and exercise
when possible. Then, add in other tactics as you see fit, but incorporate them
gently and slowly. Don’t try everything at once! It might seem awesome to just
be in the state of awakening right now, but you likely aren’t emotionally ready to
work through those chakra blockages yet, and if you force the movement of
kundalini too harshly, you can do some lasting energetic damage to it, your
chakras, and yourself as a whole.
Will this awakening get in the way of my work?
It’s not likely that kundalini awakening will get in the way of your work, but
when you’re in those pre-activation stages where things are detoxifying, you
may want to be a little more patient with your co-workers or even take a mental
health day when possible. It’s not altogether necessary for you to take off from
work, and it’s probably energetically better for you to work through any
hardships rather than avoid them, but it can also sometimes help. As a piece of
advice for those working through tough emotional remnants at work, try
grounding as much as possible. Breathe deeply and try to find a moment or two
of peace to meditate. Ground yourself in your goals and your truth, then see if
anything has changed.
Will this awakening get in the way of my family?
There’s virtually no reason why your kundalini awakening should get in the way
of family time. If you have a family and you’re concerned about this question in
particular, make sure that you schedule your meditations for times when you can
be alone. Make sure that you take your family’s needs into account as much as
possible but be communicative about what you’re going through so that they can
be compassionate and understanding alongside you as you grow. If it’s extended
family you’re worried about, just stick with your truth and stay grounded if they
attempt to challenge you. If grounding fails, take that quintessential step back
and take a deep breath. Put a pin in the idea and allow yourself to process it fully
later when you can handle it better.
What happens if my kundalini starts awakening and
stops?
This experience is more common than you may think, and I think it happens
because people are doing one of two things. (1) They could be forcing the
awakening in the first place, and their bodies were catching up with them. (2)
They could also be coming to a point with awakening where they feel they know
everything, and then kundalini slithers back down to rest because that arrogance
does not leave any space for growth. If you had an awakening start and stop in
the past, consider your actions. If you’re ready to try again, keep in mind that
past outcome and use it as a motivating teacher moving forward.
Does exercise help or hinder awakening of this type?
Exercise is a great boost to one’s kundalini awakening, as long as you’re not
overdoing it! In fact, practicing an awakening without any sort of physical
exercise means that the awakening would be completely unbalanced if it could
even be achieved. Physical exercise helps the body process scars from trauma in
ways our brains might not even be able to understand. Whether it’s dance,
running, lifting, core work, aerial arts, yoga, or anything else, just do it! Your
body (and kundalini) will be thankful you did!
What will the awakening look like once it’s finally
achieved?
Awakening is never quite “fully achieved.” It’s more of an on-going process in
and through the depths of spirituality and divinity as one’s life progresses.
However, the individual in the process of awakening will be and act a certain
way in the world as he or she gets used to the potential involved in awakening.
The individual will be kinder than normal to everyone, more interested in
higher-vibration conversation and food, and more open to friendliness. He or she
will likely meditate daily and hold a routine that provides physical and energetic
release in many forms. The individual may even dabble with tantric sex with his
or her partner. This person will somehow just know things and want to work in
service of others or in a healing-related profession.
Will I have special abilities once my kundalini is
awakened?
To make a long story short, yes, you will, however, it’s not about these special
abilities. Awakening is about a lifelong mission of connecting with divinity, and
these abilities further the cause. Make sure that you have your eyes on the real
prize when you ask questions like this. If you need a hard and fast answer, check
out the final chapter of this book.
How long will this process take?
The process of awakening can take anywhere from a few weeks to several years.
Everyone is different. Everyone comes at the experience at a different time in
their lives, carrying different sets of pain from this lifetime, ancestral burdens,
and chakra blockages because of them both. There is no right or wrong amount
of time, and there is no one right answer, either. It will take as long as it takes,
and no longer.
How do I know if I’m doing something wrong?
It’s relatively hard to do something “wrong” other than completely forcing the
process of awakening or kundalini rising. However, if you need to troubleshoot
your experience, you can check out Chapter 4, and if you need some stronger
advice, I have just what you need. Basically, you’ll know if something’s wrong
for you because it won’t feel right. The more you strengthen your intuition, the
more you’ll have a better sense of what’s in alignment with your goals and
what’s harming your vibration. Furthermore, the more in touch you become with
your guardians and spirit guides, the more you’ll be able to use their support for
advice for questions like this.
Other than meditation and yoga, what can I do to help
the process along?
I would honestly recommend just taking things as they come. Try to read as
much as possible. Meditate daily and practice yoga. Add new techniques into the
mix over time. Check out the next chapter for some details on how to do exactly
that. As always, try to take a step back if you’re consciously trying to rush
things.
Does kundalini awakening help with ADHD and other
disorders?
Absolutely. Sometimes, people with ADHD often suffer from chakra imbalances
that don’t correlate well. For instance, someone’s mind is completely out of
alignment with their heart or voice or solar plexus. For these people, standard
medicine does not really help or cure the overall problem. Kundalini awakening
won’t either, but it will get to the root of those chakra issues and help to resolve
certain things from that perspective. Energetic or mood disorders are often
helped by kundalini awakening, although in varying degrees. If you find that
you’re working toward kundalini awakening and your mental chatter becomes
unbearable no matter what you try, you may not be able to combine awakening
and your disorder well at all. In that case, don’t force yourself to continue. Try
doing things another way, and if that still doesn’t feel good, leave the kundalini
awakening for someone else instead.
Chapter 2: Kundalini 101
Now that you understand some of the basic information about your kundalini,
what it is, and how it works in your body, it’s time to get into the details. This
chapter will go through 10 specific benefits to kundalini awakening, 10 myths
about the kundalini and awakening, and 21 signs to notice and appreciate your
own awakening as it takes place. Be prepared to be blown away.
10 Benefits to Awakening
As we go over these 10 benefits to kundalini awakening, it is important to keep
in mind that these wonderful effects are surely impressive, but to focus on them
as your only goals in awakening detracts from the full experience that’s possible
for you to have. Take in each benefit and be grateful for its potential, but don’t
get too caught up in the “me, me, me” mentality that is so closely connected with
ego. Be grateful and glad for yourself and others that these changes are now
possible for you, and then your approach will be aligned with your highest
intention.
Increased intelligence and IQ capacity
As you begin your process of awakening, your mind will become clearer, and
your mental capacities will become deepened and enriched in potential. You’ll
be able to multitask and organize better than ever, and you may even see that
your IQ number literally rises as your kundalini starts moving within. As shakti
energy flips and rolls through your chakras, it will reach your third eye and
crown chakra, unlocking these mental capacities just as easily as it works on
your heart and healing.
Greater sense of peace, bliss, and tranquility
One of the most commonly experienced benefits of kundalini awakening
includes an increased sense of peace, bliss, tranquility, and trust in the universe
that you’re exactly where you should be. Chalk it up to the meditation or the
yoga or even the being in nature, but it’s also true that when your kundalini
awakening begins and becomes sustained, you will be able to find a deep and
lasting peace even in moments outside of nature or meditation. You will begin
noticing how that peace exists in an inner space that you carry with you always
and everywhere.
Greater sense of purpose and mission in this lifetime
As shakti flows through your body, bringing light, insight, and connectivity to
your mind, heart, organs, soul, and more, you will begin finding greater
experience of synchronicities in your life. Patterns will emerge, and you will
begin noticing signs that point you in productive or enlightening directions. Even
more, you will find that you’re noticing what you’re drawn to, what you’ve
always been interested in, and how that can translate to you beginning to live out
your purpose and soul mission in this lifetime. As your awakening progresses,
you will be more and more confident of the direction and theme of your mission,
and by the height of it, you will find that mission in motion.
Increased sense perceptions
Most people who undergo kundalini awakening at some point realize that their
senses have been heightened. From smell to taste, hearing, touch, sight, and even
the sixth psychic sense, the senses of the individual blossom and become honed
like the edge of a knife’s blade. You may find that one or two senses become
heightened while the rest remain the same, and you may even find that some of
your senses are dulled for a week or so while the others are heightened in their
place. No matter how it happens for you, don’t be alarmed or overwhelmed; you
will either adjust or your senses will come to balance eventually!
Anti-aging capacity in the mind & body
Some of the benefits that come along with kundalini awakening involve physical
anti-aging manifestations, such as feeling stronger and more attractive, actually
having stronger and healthier skin and hair, experiencing increased autophagy,
and experiencing a generally slowed-down aging process. For the mind, too,
kundalini awakening keeps you young, spry, and able to handle anything. It can
even slow down or reverse the effects of degenerative brain disorders.
Better connection to divinity, god, the goddess, the
light, etc.
As you continue on with the process of kundalini awakening, even if you begin
as a staunch atheist, you can still find yourself questioning yourself and those
beliefs for the incredible and connective, spiritual experiences that are possible
through kundalini awakening are hard to take in without beginning to believe in
something bigger than yourself. For those who think their faith is the one true
faith, they may find their certainty wavering and opened up into something new
and different through their experiences of kundalini awakened, but I promise, it
will hardly be an uncomfortable adjustment.
Increased capacity for sexual pleasure (gateway to
tantric sex)
As the kundalini and shakti energy start flowing in your body without blockage,
you may find that your capacity for sexual pleasure is totally altered. It might
sound crazy and unconnected to the kundalini and its rising but remember what
the kundalini rises through--your chakras--and that base chakra is all about
sexuality, security, protection, and safety. Eventually, as that root chakra gets
opened and cleansed and the kundalini starts to rise, you have the possibility to
experience more intense orgasms, and your orgasms may even occur
spontaneously, as one of the side-effects of awakening. You will come to learn
how to control and focus this orgasmic, creation energy, and part of that focus
can be translated into a whole new world: tantric sex. Kundalini awakening and
tantric sex go hand in hand, for the higher vibration awareness required for one
is intimately connected with the other.
Increased psychic abilities
Along with those increased sense perceptions for your basic 5 senses, your sixth
sense will get a kick in its pants, too. You stand the chance to experience psychic
awakening on a number of levels as you advance through your kundalini
awakening. Whether your gifts are numerous or singular, they will be lifealtering. You may receive or unlock the ability to see visions, to see signs or
future events, to know things before they happen, to move things without
touching them, to attract things into your life, to see or hear others’ thoughts and
feelings, to heal others without touching them, to know what people need, and
more. Moreover, remember that if you don’t end up experiencing any psychic
abilities or their increase, it could be because your higher self knows you’re not
ready to use them correctly or for the purest means. Reconsider your motivations
and proceed with that insight in mind.
Greater sense of o0ne’s manifestation capacity
The law of attraction is one of the 12 universal laws that define the nature of our
physical reality. What we put out into the universe comes back to us. Even
without kundalini awakening, all humans retain this capacity to alter their worlds
and draw into their lives exactly what they may need. However, with the
kundalini awakened or in the process of flowing, one’s abilities to attract what
one needs and to manifest one’s goals and desires will become heightened. This
will warrant an increased responsibility and sensibility on behalf of the
individual in question, as the saying from Spiderman is true, “With great power
comes great responsibility.”
Physical relief from certain illnesses & diseases
Many individuals suffering from chronic illnesses or struggling through
exhausting diseases will find relief from these woes during their process of
kundalini awakening. Due to all the anti-aging and pain-relieving physical
effects that kundalini awakening can afford, these people are clearly warranted
to receive relief in this way. For those with cancer, life-threatening illnesses,
aut0-immune disorders, and more, it could be that the process of kundalini
awakening will give you that boost of relief that you’ve been craving.
10 Myths about Kundalini & Its Awakening
There are a lot of myths floating around about what kundalini is, how it gets
awakened, and what its awakening can look like. There are especially a lot of
negative myths, but kundalini awakening is a practice that’s existed for
millennia, and its approach can exist in multiple different incarnations. It can
mean a bad experience for someone who approaches his or her awakening with
impure goals in mind, but it still means such a positive experience for so many
others that it’s helpful to tease out what’s fact and what’s fiction before moving
forward unknowingly, with inaccurate assumptions. While it’s certainly true that
no one way to awakening is the right way, this section will surely help you to
spot out some of the veins of thinking about kundalini that are not worth your
concern.
Kundalini awakening is dangerous, and the energy
released is frightening.
Kundalini awakening is far from dangerous. For those who don’t understand the
process, it may seem bizarre that some people have outbursts during meditation
or experience muscle spasms or spontaneous crying. It may seem unhealthy that
people are changing their diet to something radically different than they’ve eaten
their entire lives. It may seem shocking to some that people are establishing
better connections to the divine. However it may seem, kundalini awakening is
safe and productive, and the energy released is far from frightening; it’s healthy,
natural, and enlightened.
Kundalini awakening is tied to one specific religion
(or it’s a cult).
While “kundalini” comes from the Sanskrit and takes its linguistic origin from
ancient India, there is no specific religion attached to kundalini awakening.
When the process of kundalini awakening was started by Yogi Bhajan and his
practice of kundalini yoga, even that practice of yoga was a more secular
appreciation of divinity and one’s connection to the powers of the universe and
of creation itself. Kundalini does not connect with any cult or religious dogma.
It’s simply something that exists within you in relation to source energy, and it
can be awakened if you like, hence the purpose of this text.
You will have to wear a headpiece constantly once
your kundalini is awakened.
Some believe that your awakened state makes you more sensitive, warranting the
covering of one’s head to protect the crown and third eye chakras, the aura, and
the brain. Whether the headpiece is a turban, a scarf, a bandana, or otherwise,
these individuals think you just need some sort of covering. However, there is no
evidence that this headpiece and its use in covering the head actually help in
protecting one’s energetic state. Kundalini and shakti energy will not be able to
escape through the top of your skull and seep out your scalp, so there really is no
point for concern on this issue.
Kundalini awakening all goes back to sex.
While kundalini awakening obviously has correlations with sex, sexual health,
and sexual awakening, it absolutely does not have to deal with such themes.
Sometimes, kundalini awakening will enable one to heal from traumas caused by
these themes and actions in one’s life, and the farthest thing from this
individual’s mind will be to incorporate sex again as quickly as possible.
Thankfully, kundalini awakening would never rush or force something like that.
As with all types of healing, sex can be incorporated when and if you’re ready,
and not before that point.
Your relationship with your friends and your family
will suffer after you’re awakened.
While you may develop different interests from your family, causing you to
want to spend your time differently than they do, your connections with these
people never have to suffer because of your awakening process. In fact, your
patience with them and understanding of them should only increase, aiding your
relationship. If you find yourself having less and less time or patience for these
people, you might need to reconsider what role you want them to play in your
life or what role you actually want to play in theirs. In your case, it could be that
kundalini is reminding you that family is more than just blood, and you don’t
have to settle for those who traumatize and abuse you. Essentially, your
relationship will only suffer when your higher self is ready for it to be over.
Kundalini awakening is all about breathing and
meditation; it’s not physical at all.
Kundalini awakening was originally tied explicitly to the practice of kundalini
yoga. In those times, it was always already connected between physical and
spiritual, movement and breath, and yoga and meditation. Therefore, even today,
kundalini awakening should not be just one of these extremes. It should never be
just yoga or just meditation. It should never be just nature walks or meditations
outdoors. Kundalini awakening should always incorporate both so that the mind,
body, and soul–all three parts of the individual–can be awakened together,
leaving no part behind and leaving nothing forgotten.
You can only experience kundalini awakening if
you’re led by a guru.
This myth was propagated by the creator of kundalini yoga, Yogi Bhajan, and it
makes sense why he would establish it. In his time, no one was practicing
kundalini awakening on a wide scale. People didn’t have immediate information
from the spread of the internet either. It was the 1960s, and people actually
needed a guide so that they didn’t feel crazy or get something big wrong. These
days, this earnest and productive sentiment on Yogi Bhajan’s behalf has much
less use for us. With the onset of the internet and the abilities we have to teach
one another from this information, you can comfortably teach yourself to
meditate and guide yourself through kundalini awakening with hardly so much
as a word of input from another person.
Only certain people can have this awakening happen
because it’s so difficult.
For starters, it’s a misconception to think that kundalini awakening is a difficult
endeavor. It’s not actually hard at all; it’s just that kundalini awakening requires
steadfastness, commitment, determination, and focus. These traits are simply
harder for some to come by than others, but even if they’re not naturally in your
wheelhouse, kundalini awakening will help you adapt and incorporate them into
your practice so that things become easier by the breath. Now, to the overall
myth: anyone–I repeat, anyone–can experience kundalini awakening. It’s not
that it’s difficult, and it’s not only for certain people. Anyone can handle the
awakening, and it just depends on whether or not you’re ready and able to
withstand the entire experience. If you’re having trouble, don’t think that it
won’t work for you. Instead, look to your wounds, your traumas, and your scars.
Consider going to a therapist at least once and then attempt the awakening again.
It may be that you need to work something else out in a big way before you can
work upwards, so to speak.
The only way to awaken your kundalini is to have
reiki done for you.
While it may seem that reiki and kundalini awakening are explicitly tied to one
another, they absolutely are not. You can awaken your kundalini without having
anything to do with reiki. You can do reiki for years without ever doing a
kundalini awakening, too. It’s more so that kundalini awakening and reiki
healing overlap well than that they need to be used together. If you’re having a
lot of trouble with your awakening, you might try having reiki done in order to
tell where your chakras’ blockages are and how problematic those flow issues
are for your goals. However, there’s no need to combine these practices at all,
and you can absolutely awaken your kundalini without having reiki done to/for
you.
You’ll get superhuman powers with Kundalini
Awakening.
No, kundalini awakening won’t turn you into a super hero. It won’t make you
superhuman, either. If you consider psychic gifts and developments superhuman
abilities, though, you might want to reconsider your phrasing. It is true that
kundalini awakening can unlock your psychic gifts. However, psychic abilities
aren’t as extraordinary for humans to possess as we might imagine. Originally,
humans had as many senses as we have chakras (which is actually 22), but we
became blind, deaf, and dumb, so to speak, after a fall from grace. Now, we
hardly even have enough senses as we have chakras in the body (7). The original
22 senses were all “psychic” and any ability one has to reconnect with the 17
lost senses is an extraordinarily natural ability, indeed.
21 Signs of Kundalini Awakening
As you begin the process of kundalini awakening, it will be immensely helpful
to be aware that many things will happen to you, some of them wild, but what’s
happening to you does not mean that you’re crazy. In fact, it likely means that
you’re exactly in line with where you should be in the process. In this section,
you’ll be introduced to over 20 signs or “symptoms” of your ongoing
awakening.
They’re sure to test your ability to take your ego and pride out of your practice
and focus on what good you can share with the world instead (because what
you’re in for is truly, undeniably incredible).
Feelings of lightning bolts in the body
You can tell you’re well on your way to full-fledged awakening when you start
feeling tingling sensations ranging from vibrations to lightning bolts in your
body. It’s a strange experience, but it won’t last forever, and I promise you, it’s a
good sign.
Waves of hot and cold flashes
As you’re on your way to kundalini awakening, you may experience extreme hot
and cold flashes, reminiscent of a woman going through menopause. These
flashes won’t be isolated to any one area of the body. You may be able to find a
pattern in their waves, but they could also be totally random.
Spontaneous emotional release during meditation
Whether it’s anger, crying, laughter, sadness, joy, or otherwise, any strange and
strong emotions that arise during meditation are sure-fire signs that your
awakening is well underway. The rising kundalini is helping you process
emotional blockages to your system with this effort.
Making animal sounds or gestures during meditation
Similarly, you may find that you experience intense moments of what can only
be described as “animal expression” in meditation. Again, your kundalini is
working on helping you process and clear energetic blockages, and that work is
often best done through animal spirits and expressions.
Hands, limbs, and feet tend to go numb and tingle
As the kundalini and shakti energy of awakening start to rewire how things are
working in your heart chakra, your physical heart may be occasionally affected.
Don’t be worried if you experience your hands, limbs, or feet falling asleep more
than usual. It’s absolutely normal for your “condition.”
Increased desire to visit ancient & sacred places
If you experience more and more powerful strong urges to go travel the world
and see those famous ancient, sacred sites, don’t question those drives! They’re
undoubtedly connected to your process of awakening, and you should follow up
on them as much as you are able.
Frequent sensory overload (at the beginning)
If you’ve been working with kundalini and shakti energy for a while and you’re
not sure you’re seeing effects, look to your senses. Have you been overwhelmed
or overloaded easily recently? Have you been more sensitive than normal?
Chances are that these emotional side effects are related to your senses and are
therefore inspired by your awakening.
Spontaneous waves of bliss or even pleasure
It could be that kundalini awakening has the reputation of being all about sex
because of this symptom or sign of the process. It is true that some people can
experience spontaneous waves of ecstasy or tranquil bliss. It doesn’t happen
often, but some people can also spontaneously orgasm, based on how their
chakra blockages are being cleared and how the serpent is moving. It’s
incredible, but it’s definitely a sign of awakening!
Periods of extremely heightened creativity
Especially as you start to work through blockages of the sacral chakra, you’ll
begin to have extremely creative periods, and these moments are absolutely
proof of awakening. Even if those periods don’t last very long or aren’t sustained
over time, they’ll allow you to make creative works that help boost your
awakening endurance overall.
Mouth fills up with water during meditation
You may find that your mouth keeps filling up with water during your practice
of meditation. Don’t go to the doctor wondering what’s wrong with your body!
It’s just a side effect of the kundalini’s movement through your system, and it’s
absolutely a good sign.
Spontaneous singing of old songs (you haven’t heard)
or practicing of ancient yogic techniques (you’ve
never even tried)
Part of what happens during kundalini awakening is that one finds connections
to his or her past lives, and sometimes, one will find that old techniques of the
trade for awakening will surface for him or her in meditation that this person
could never have known beforehand.
Feeling intense headaches during meditation that
resolve themselves easily
If you do experience intense headaches during meditation, try not to take pain
relief medicine for them! Try to ride out the meditation, and if the headache
resolves itself at the end, then it’s for sure that you’re working out third eye or
crown chakra blockages and your kundalini awakening is almost fully in effect.
Receiving visions of skeletons or ancestors during
meditation
Some of the more spoken-about side effects or signs of awakening include the
ability to see the dead, one’s ancestors, or skeletons. Some people make their
entire focus during awakening to have this ability, but it should not be so. If you
experience these visions, simply know you’re on the right path and do not be
afraid. The ways you can use this ability will be revealed to you in time. For
now, stay grounded and don’t let yourself get too scared or excited.
Frequent mood swings in day-to-day life
You may find that you’re more sensitive than normal, especially emotionally. If
your mood swings are more extreme and intense than you’re used to, take it easy
on others and yourself. It’s all a part of awakening, and it will definitely resolve
itself in time.
Hearing sounds (like music) that no one else hears
As your past life and ancestral memories become unlocked, you might find
yourself tapping into sound memories that no one else can perceive. As you
receive messages about yoga, meditation, and spirituality through meditation,
these tones may accompany the knowledge, but it’s all just a part of ascension.
Don’t go running to the doctor or your therapist quite yet and don’t be afraid.
Receiving spontaneous waves of wisdom, insight, or
knowledge
The more and more aligned your chakras become and the more freely this
energy serpent moves, the more synchronicities you’ll receive in daily life and
the more often you’ll experience these beautiful little moments of intense clarity
and insight. These epiphanies will happen with increasing frequency through
your awakening.
Seeing visions from the past
You may find yourself going on deep and convincingly-real walks through
memory lane during awakening, and you may also receive literal visions into
your past lives, those selves, and their behaviors. Don’t be alarmed. Your
kundalini is guiding you through the information you need to receive to reach
full awakening.
Feelings of deep and unshakeable purity
As you shed toxicity and layers of “dirt” from your chakras, you’ll find that you
feel increasingly “pure” and connected to all aspects of divinity. It may sound
strange to you now, but divine “purity” is not something to scoff at–it’s a state of
mind that’s blissful, trusting, faithful, and absolutely growth-oriented.
Diseases start to become healed
While it’s true that some signs of awakening include the lessening of physical
symptoms of disease and illness, it can also be the case that one’s diseases and
illnesses begin to become literally healed in this process.
Personality quirks are lessened and smoothed out
Many people end up working out personality kinks when their kundalinis are
awakened. Surely, when it comes to the chakras, blockages can manifest as
problematic or negative personality traits, so when that awakening process starts
up and becomes fully activated, the personality will become like a canvas or like
clay that is ready to be painted on or sculpted to the will of divinity.
Increased artistic inspiration from nature & others
Especially if you’re an artist who’s gone through a dry spell in terms of creative
motivation for a long while, it will be a clear sign of awakening when you find
more and more inspiration from the natural and day-to-day. It doesn’t even have
to be explicitly from nature, for during the process of awakening, it could be that
general interpersonal interactions or the movement of cars or public
transportation are enough to inspire you now.
Chapter 3: Kundalini Awakening
This chapter is dedicated to those readers who are ready to work directly on
kundalini awakening. In the subsequent pages, you will find 29 techniques to
help your kundalini awakening along, and the chapter ends with 6 additional
methods that you can try to boost your experience. Whether you’ve felt
kundalini awakening before or you just learned about it for the first time through
this book, the tips included in this chapter are guaranteed to provide substance,
depth, and insight into your experiences as you proceed.
29 Awakening Techniques
Ranging from meditation techniques to interpersonal tips and simple world
navigation tactics, the options provided in this section will help you move past
simple knowledge of kundalini and awakening to the place where knowledge
can be put into practice. Gather your yoga mat, your incense, and your mind, for
things are about to get amplified.
Apply kundalini yoga to your practice
The more that you’re able to do so, adding physical layers to your meditative
practice will be incredibly beneficial. Kundalini yoga is the best place to start,
especially if you’re working on kundalini awakening in particular, rather than
just awareness or chakra balancing. Kundalini yoga will help you work through
those chakra blockages and get the kundalini going while boosting your
meditative practice within the dimension of the moving human body. You’ll be
surprised how well it all works together once you start amplifying your practice
with yoga.
Use visualization techniques to increase shakti
movement
Visualization is almost essential to use as a means of increasing shakti
movement throughout your body in the form of your kundalini. The ancient
Indians were on the right page when they gave relatable names to these cosmic
wells of energy within us. They understood how powerful metaphor and imagery
can be when it comes to the workings of the inner body (and one’s subtle
energy). For example, as a reminder, “kundalini” means little coiled one–the
snake of universe or source energy (shakti) that exists at the base of our spine.
We are meant to imagine this snake being charmed and winding its way through
our chakras. We are meant to visualize this and many more things. The more
visualization you can incorporate into your practice, the better.
Use guided meditation techniques to increase shakti
movement
A lot of people need help detaching from the distractions of the mind and the
world before they can focus enough to visualize these intricate inner movements.
In this cases, I always recommend guided meditation. There are so many ways to
help raise your kundalini based on the techniques people share on online
meditation forums and even on sites like YouTube. Audio books of guided
meditations could also provide the guidance you’ll need to be able to shut off
that conscious brain and simply, meditatively focus on the shakti–that pure and
potent source energy that wants to move within you. Seek out these guided
meditations for kundalini awakening, and you’ll be so grateful you did.
Try pulling the kundalini up from your crown
This technique, in terms of an awakening booster, is a little more detail-oriented
than some others. It comes to the way you visualize the kundalini moving from
that spinal source within you to the tip of your crown and back down.
Essentially, you’ll want to try shifting your focus. If you’ve been imagining
things (as most of us will innately do) as if the serpent has been rising up from
your base–with that root chakra as your energetic center from which it leaves
and to which it eventually returns–switch things up in an impactful yet subtle
way. Imagine your crown chakra as your energetic center and see the kundalini
being pulled up through your body, as if drawn by a magnet that rests at the top
of your head. Then, once the kundalini rises to this crown point, imagine that
you pull the “magnet” away and let the serpent “fall” down back to its opposite
end before returning with the magnet replaced. Remember that you are a
spiritual being having a human experience, as many have said elsewhere. Your
crown chakra holds your purest potential, and shakti energy responds well to that
once you reclaim it as your energetic “source.”
Change your mindset
There are a few unintentional roadblocks that tend to come up for many
kundalini practitioners. Mainly, you’ll want to perform a couple of checks to
ensure that your mindset is as aligned with kundalini awakening as possible.
Reject as many sources of negativity in your life as you can. If you can’t get rid
of them, try to face them and call them out, or you could just out-right ignore
them. On a personal level, too, you can work to change negativity into its
opposite extreme of expression when it comes to your personality traits, your
routines, habits, and more. Furthermore, the less attachment you have to material
things and patterns, the more open you become to the changes awakening has in
store for you. Overall, therefore, reject (and possibly counteract) negativity and
attachment, and you will surely flourish. (As a general note, if this method
doesn’t work for you, don’t force yourself to attempt it, especially if it creates
toxic effects for you. In that case, you may have a blockage of third eye or crown
chakra that needs to be worked through before full awakening can be achieved.)
Play the observer
Do you often find yourself as the center of attention, in more than just a teamsport-member or theatre-troupe-member way? Do you generally crave that type
of support and public awareness? Now comes the trickier part. When you are the
center of attention, do you notice things better or worse? Do you take in the
whole picture or do you get tunnel vision for only what you’re doing (and
perhaps what the viewer takes in)? I’d be willing to venture a guess that you
aren’t fully aware of what’s going on, particularly in your surroundings, at times
when you fill that public position. Maybe a little more time spent playing the
observer instead would help you. For people who resonate with the message
behind this point, try to be a little more subtle in public settings. See who rises
up instead and then just listen to what they have to say. Interrupt your needs and
urges in this way, and your kundalini will realize what a powerful energetic shift
you’re instigating, responding to its own way in kind.
Find a teacher, supporter, guru, or mentor
If you are ready to do so and are able, begin to approach the idea of meeting and
partnering up with a teacher. Whether you consider them a strong and smart
supporter, a mentor, a patron, a teacher, a guru, or otherwise, simply begin to
consider the possibility of a person like this entering your life. As you continue
practicing meditation, yoga, and the rest of your kundalini rising techniques,
you’ll likely find that your vibration attracts exactly that which you desire. Now,
this attraction effort will involve a bit of action on your part to keep the vibration
going, but the actions involved are easier than they sound. Essentially, it’s this: if
you get any hunches in this process, follow them. If you think you ought to talk
to this new person in particular, trust yourself and go for it. If you want to try
eating at a different restaurant, go there and be open to what happens. You can
find your teacher in the places you’d least expect; just remain open for
experiences, conversations, encounters, and situations that will change your
world. Sometimes, just living out that openness is action enough.
Use chanting & kirtan
Some more traditional elements of kundalini awakening involve the combination
of mind and body through chanting and singing. This mind-body alignment is
not only already incredibly productive for shakti energy’s flow through your
system, but also, this combination, in particular, with its focus being expressed
through vocalization, will really help those practitioners struggling with throat
chakra blockages. Spontaneous chanting is a symptom or sign of kundalini
awakening, too, so maybe a bit of practicing will help you get there. To start, try
chanting your mantra or your vision of either exactly what you want to happen
with your kundalini awakening or your detailed “happy place.” If you follow a
religious devotion, you could try a prayer to your god or goddess. If you don’t
mind which religion you follow and you simply want to get involved with some
sort of active divinity, seek out a local kirtan. Kirtan is a gathering where songs
of Sanskrit prayer are sung about many different gods and goddesses.
Interestingly enough, “kirtan” means basically “narrating or telling,” while
“bhajan,” the name of the yogi who brought kundalini yoga to the West, means
“sharing” in a similar context as “kirtan,” with particular emphasis through song.
I’m sure this is not completely coincidence.
Do things that make you truly happy
Think back to the time when you were a kid. Put yourself in that mental and
emotional space. What did you do for fun? What did you like to daydream
about? Go back to memories before puberty. What unrealistic and absolutely
fantastical goals did you have? What did you think you’d want to be, and can
you remember why you felt that way? Put yourself in that space. Remember
what you did to feel truly happy. Now, think of today. Is there any equivalent to
that thing that made you so happy from your past that lingers today? Do you still
strive to live out those goals and to be happy those same ways? Or have you
given up on those feelings for any number of reasons? Now’s the time to think a
little. Even if you don’t have those dreams anymore, think of what they meant to
you. Think of what they could have really meant in terms of your bigger picture.
For instance, one child’s unrealistic goals of being a tree climber for a future
career could transform into her future needs to be outside often. The goal in this
case is to align your life with those innocent and unrealistic dreams, however it
is humanly possible for you to do so. Connect with that deep and lasting
childlike happiness, and your kundalini will surely respond.
Practice saying “yes”
Especially for those who have trouble going with the flow, this practice of
saying “yes” as often as possible may actually jolt their kundalinis into action! If
you relate to the previous statement, it’s likely because you do attempt to hold
too tightly to control in your life, so you’ll need a little help going with the flow.
The most kundalini-applicable reason that this could be the case is that your
solar plexus chakra is blocked, imbalanced, or spinning in the wrong direction.
To those readers that need to hear this, say “yes” more often; you deserve it!
Give yourself a break and go with the experiences and possibilities that present
themselves to you, rather than the ones you cling to or pull desperately your way.
Get loose! Say “yes,” and go with the flow. Kundalini will know what to do.
Practice saying “no”
Similar to the last point but decidedly different, some people are too easygoing
and can’t help but get caught up in the flow. In these cases, the individual might
feel like their greatest fears revolve around not being able to say “no” when it
really matters. Therefore, the technique for individuals who relate to this
message would be to practice saying “no” anytime you’d normally be “pushed
over,” for the sake of the phrase’s appropriateness. If people like to turn
responsibilities over to you, say “no” as if you aren’t going to lose anything.
Turn down dates to have nights in. Turn down hangouts to give some self-love
instead. Every time you say “no,” though, remember that you’re doing this to
regain strength and boost your soul. Don’t let that solar plexus chakra remain
imbalanced; say “no” and that blockage will start to disappear.
Use music therapy
A more physician-approved technique for psychological and soulful awakening
of any kind would be music therapy, but I don’t mean that you have to book a
doctor’s appointment today. I simply mean that you can find music that supports
your goals and listen to it as much as possible. Look for artists who support your
causes and check out their music. Look for songs that talk about what you want
to manifest in your life. Look for tunes that remind you of being a kid. You can
direct your search in a multitude of ways, and you can even find full albums of
kundalini awakening meditation music on YouTube. If you’re not into the words
and tunes of others, you can create your own songs to process anything you
might be going through (that could also be blocking your chakras) to take
possession of this music therapy experience and give it your full bodily
endorsement. Use music however you need to, and if you have any spontaneous
hot or cold flashes, emotional outbursts, or laughing bursts, you’ll know you’re
on the right path.
Use sound therapy
Similarly, you could try using just one tone at a time to guide your meditation if
the busy-ness of music gets distracting because of how sensitive you are. Some
of us can’t handle music when we’re meditating; it’s too distracting to start off
with. Some of us can’t handle words of any kind happening when we’re
meditating either. Of course, some people don’t have these struggles, but others
cannot escape them. Even people who don’t necessarily need to simplify found
more sound therapy can work incredible wonders. As I was saying at the start of
this point, you can try using just one tone at a time to boost your meditation or
yoga. You can chant words at the pitch of the chakra you’re working on, or you
could just say “ohm” again and again at the same pitch. You could even take
your voice out of it and play one note repeated, whether through YouTube, a
musical instrument, or otherwise. See what these tones do for you, for it might
be just the trick.
Use art therapy
Instead of using music or sound, maybe art is your thing! You could always try
going to a few local art museums and just wander around to see what triggers
something in you. Or you could pull up some art on your phone or your laptop to
see what helps you feel inspired again. Differently, you could also get back into
creating your own art. I know you have it in you, no matter how deeply you’ve
buried it! In addition, just because people say it’s “art” doesn’t mean what you
make has to be good by their standards! Just create something. You’ll be so glad
you did, and even if you’re not glad and you end up hating it, even in the act of
destroying what you’ve made, you might find some inner satisfaction that
triggers our slithery spirit friend, the kundalini.
Use color therapy
Do you remember what color really is? Do you remember being taught in
science class when you were young about how color is just different
wavelengths of light being bounced off things and perceived by our limited
human eyes? Do you remember all that? If not, take it in because I can almost
guarantee you’ve never thought about what all this really means. Certain colors
will then have wavelengths and vibrations that heal things within us, sometimes
even without us knowing. Each chakra has a color, and the wearing of that color
is supposed to help cleanse or open that chakra, but did you ever think of the
other implications? Sure, colors associate with chakras, but they also can just
affect us in terms of healing that we may not be able to perceive. Colors have
healing capacity that’s so subtle and so intrinsic to our daily lives that we hardly
even notice. Getting back in touch with subtle energy and color healing will
undoubtedly help you connect with your kundalini and instigate its rise.
Spend less time on screens
It may sound basic and unnecessary, but you still need to hear it: the less time
you spend on technology, the better. Especially as you begin opening up and
experiencing kundalini awakening, you will become very sensitive, even more
so than you normally are. It’s like a vicious cycle because that sensitivity has
dire implications for your awakening goals, too. You might become triggered
into lower states of being by the news or social media feeds. You might be
distracted too much from your higher purpose by scrolling on social media all
day. You might be too jam-packed with the vibrations of your technological
devices that you can’t find your own in the haze. The basic gist is this: the less
technology you rely on, the more your vibration is yours and the clearer your
focus will be. With less screen time, the more you’re clean.
Change up your social media feed
I know it’s hard to fully detach from social media. It’s really, really hard for
some in comparison with others, and it’s particularly true for those individuals
that I provide this recommendation to. Instead of cutting out social media
completely, I challenge you to complete these steps. First, choose just one form
of social media that you can use to get a bit of everything you might need (i.e.,
spiritual information, family contact, friend contact, self-expression, community
boost, business boost, etc.) and cut out all the others. Second, on this social
media, cut down your posts drastically each week. Third, change up your social
media feed by cleaning up your friend’s list, the hashtags you follow, and the
pages you like. Remember that you can attract spiritual information through
social media, too; you just have to work for it. With these three actions taking
place, you’ve made some powerful steps in the right direction, and if things
don’t drastically change for you within after two weeks, I’ll be extremely
surprised.
Trust in the universe, in felicity, and in synchronicity
It’s going to be hard at first, especially if you’ve never practiced this type of
radical trust before, but you’re going to have to put some faith in the workings of
the world around you. You can do a lot for yourself for the sake of healing and
growth, and others can teach you a lot as well, but the world and what’s bigger
can teach you more than you can ever imagine. Look up the term “felicity.”
Then look up the term “synchronicity.” Now, look up “serendipity.” Start
looking for these experiences in your life, and they’ll surely appear.
Furthermore, start keeping a journal of the synchronicities you experience, and I
almost guarantee that you’ll be making concrete life changes and trusting in the
universe in no time. Every sign is a lesson and every interaction, everything you
see, can be a sign. Open your eyes and relearn how to trust, and kundalini will
know what to do.
Pay closer attention to your breathing
As you begin meditating and eventually come to incorporate it into your daily
practice, you’ll start noticing your breathing more than ever. You’ll notice when
you hold it unintentionally, when you hyperventilate or are triggered, when you
are invited to breathe calmly, when you have the greatest smelling capacity, and
more. With this breathing awareness, your kundalini can’t help but respond.
What you can do to help along the process is to try to meditate daily, and when
you do meditate, breathe deep into your belly. Furthermore, if you can visualize
at all, try to visualize that each breath strokes the back of a small serpent that’s
sleeping in the pit of your stomach. Imagine that the breath meets the serpent as
if you were petting a cat that curled up in the window. With this increasingly
close attention on your breathing, your health will improve, and you will only
become more and more aligned with awakening.
Pay closer attention to your posture
If you envision the path the kundalini serpent will follow, you can see that (if
you’re standing or sitting up straight) it goes up from the root chakra to the
sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, and then finally the crown before
going back down and repeating its flow as it can. Now, envision what happens to
the flow when you hunch over and curl into the fetal position. The line from
chakra to chakra becomes a curve almost like a semi-circle. In this case, the
serpent’s path is less predictable and more difficult overall. You can help the
kundalini, in this case, by watching your posture as much as possible. Try to sit
up and stand up straight whenever possible. Don’t crunch your solar plexus
chakra and don’t tuck in your root chakra if you can help it! Moreover, if you
have trouble with straight posture, think of what chakras could be blocked and
limiting you. Think of what traumas could be standing in your way. Regardless
of what you learn, your posture can teach you a lot on your path to kundalini
awakening.
Try tapping into the “chakra channel”
In your daily meditation, try this technique specifically. You can boost the
technique with visualization, but you don’t have to, for it can be just as effective
if you just imagine what’s happening, remember your goals, and let your body
do the rest. Essentially, you’ll close your eyes with the meditation and begin to
focus your energy into the root chakra. Breathe into your belly and sense that
root chakra until you can feel a vibration there. Then, begin to chant your mantra
or simply chant “ohm” over and over again. With each repetition, feel the
vibration of the next higher chakra as the root energy moves into the sacral, the
solar plexus, the heart, the throat, the third eye, and finally the crown. Once you
reach the crown, the whole chakra channel inside you should be vibrating with
energy, and your kundalini will surely see this open and cleared space as if it
was a potential playground to explore.
Practice seeing proof of divinity in everything
Instead of closing yourself off, getting angry at everything, or shutting down
when you get upset, try to reshape the way you look at the world. You can try to
remind yourself that even when things get intense, it’s just a moment when
divinity decided to test you, providing an experience for you to get stronger if
you tap into it correctly and adequately. You can easily see the good times as
proof of divinity, and positive signs are the same. Bad times and negative times,
though, are harder, and that’s the real challenge. With practice, you’ll be able to
see the proof of divinity in every experience, challenge, advantage, situation, and
exchange, and I hope it will bring you both glee and lasting inspiration. I know,
at least, it will do that much for your kundalini (as long as your feelings and
connections with divinity aren’t forced just to get to awakening).
Connect with your spirit guides
Whether your spirit guides are real people, living or dead, who were sainted or
who invented incredible things, or your spirit guides are your ancestors or other
literal spirits, you can try getting in touch with them (spiritually or literally) for
help in relation to your kundalini awakening. Asking for help is never something
to be ashamed of, especially when it comes to something as complex and lifealtering as kundalini awakening. Reach out to your guides for advice. Let them
know the situation you’re in and what you’re hoping for. Let them know what
you’re working through and what you’re working on. If you don’t know who
your spirit guides are yet, it’s time to do a little research and begin connecting.
Think of the religion you associate with most and look at the “saints” of that
religion. Think of the ancient religion you love and its myths and gods or
goddesses. Do some research into the world of spirituality to see if your guides
will arise, and when they do, you’ll know whom you should direct these
important advice-based questions to.
Use healing crystals
While you’re working through subtle and physical energy blockages and flows,
subtle and physical helpers can make the transition into awakening all the easier.
Take crystals, for example. These earth minerals, whether raw or polished, each
contain a vibration and life essence. When you hold these vibrations around you
(especially if you’re lacking those vibrations in particular), they can impart
healing capacities to you through direct contact with the stone. Hold a healing
crystal in your hand, and you may find yourself with increased capacity for
patience, love, devotion, trust, or otherwise. For kundalini awakening, too, this
crystal healing potential is great. Crystals of different colors connect to the
chakras, and some crystals even have the unique ability to align and cleanse all 7
chakras at once. If you’re in need of a booster for your process, I absolutely
recommend going the route of crystal healing. It’s easy, it’s fun, and it can have
effects almost instantly.
Practice random acts of kindness or paying it forward
To get your vibration in line with something kundalini can work with, you can
try paying it forward as selflessly as possible. Practice random acts of kindness
and pay it forward whenever you’re able to. See what’s returned and what
hasn’t. See what comes back around even after you send it out. By working with
this spirit of compassion and sending energy out into the world like a boomerang
just waiting for it to return in some fashion, kundalini (and the shakti that gives it
life) will take notice. Soon enough, these practices may become second nature,
or they could even manifest material rewards for you closer and closer to the
moment of your initial action. Start by sending out whatever generosity and
selflessness you can into the universe and then wait to see what returns. If all
that returns is insight and knowledge, be sure to feel thankful for that! It didn’t
have to be anything at all. Working these practices may be difficult as you
attempt to live without attachments and harsh expectations, but it will only be
difficult if it poses a lesson you need to learn.
Meditate to open, cleanse & align the chakras first
It may sound simple, but you can always just start off your day with a chakra
meditation to open, cleanse, and align everything as you’re able to yourself.
Especially, if you’re well-practiced with meditation and you’re comfortable
clearing your chakras, this technique may boost you exponentially. From now
on, try to start your day with a shower and a chakra cleanse. As the water hits
you, visualize that blockages flow out of each chakra, down to your feet, and out
into the water down the drain. Visualize your inner peace and wholeness after
this cleansing is complete and imagine that your chakras have become better
aligned with each time you shower. By starting the day in this way, kundalini
will have better motion for the rest of your waking time, and your awakening
will be affected drastically.
Practice active patience & forgiveness
Sometimes, what holds us back from awakening is the grudge we cling to the
fiercest. While it can be true that holding a grudge can remind some people of
their power and their potential to determine their reality, grudges (more often
than not) are spiritually toxic. They most often correlate to blockages of the heart
chakra, and they can be corrected through active and radical expressions of love,
patience, and forgiveness. Next time you butt up against your grudges or their
related individuals, try to be the better person. Don’t just think of things that
way, though, and really live that “better person” life without the judgment of
being actually “better” or thinking that you are. Reject grudge. Reject anger,
jealousy, fear, frustration, and irritation. As you can, just express love,
forgiveness, and acceptance despite their harshness, and by rolling with those
punches, you will emotionally and spiritually grow.
Practice tantric sex with your partner
While kundalini awakening is not all about sex, some sexual practices are
incredibly useful for boosting your kundalini’s rise and increasing your shakti.
Tantric sex, in particular, is one of the healthiest and most productive sexual
practices linked with kundalini awakening. During tantric sex with your partner,
you both will try different positions together and engage in mostly the same
actions as you normally would, however, the goal of orgasm will be a little
different. Tantric sex is about holding sexual positions and holding or redirecting
orgasm, pushing endurance to its limits, to use very Western terms about it.
You’ll enter and hold these positions, building up energy between you two and
sending that energy up into your chakras rather than out into each other, so to
speak. Your kundalini is directly involved when actions of this type occur, so its
awakening may likely be very closely related to this ancient sexual practice.
Try orgasming differently
If you experience frequent orgasm but don’t yet understand or wish to practice
tantric sex, you can try focusing your orgasm into a different part of your body
in order to instigate awakening. As with the couple practicing tantric sex and
coming to orgasm, you’ll try to focus your orgasmic energy upwards, through
your chakras successively to your crown, rather than down and out through your
base. This creative energy is always lost from your body during orgasm when
you push that energy down out the root chakra, but if you keep some of that
energy for yourself by redirecting it upwards, you will invite the serpent to move
with you.
6 Other Practices That Can Help
In addition to those 29 kundalini-boosters, 6 or so more intensive practices can
be added to your daily routine to your benefit. Ranging from physical exercise to
dietary change and other modes of subtle energy healing, the methods in this
section are gateways to apply to your awakening for strengthening, deepening,
and intensifying the experience as it stands. Now it all depends on what you feel
comfortable with and what you’re willing to draw into your life.
Start running
One thing you can do is start running if you’re physically able to. Running is
great for your lungs, your heart, your bones, your posture, and more. Spiritually,
running can connect you with the potential you have to free yourself from
restriction (to a certain degree) and to create your own reality. When you’re in
the practice of running, and things really feel good, you have the sense that you
are free to go anywhere your feet can carry you. This feeling evokes pure joy for
me, and it helps me resolve feelings of being trapped in the system in other
ways. For others, too, running can provide those feelings they’re desperately
craving while increasing their bodies’ strengths and potentials. Through the
practice of running, you should focus your attention on becoming strong, gaining
endurance, and increasing the alignment of your body. If you find that you
struggle with any of these three points despite your shift into running, you may
want to eliminate it from your routine. The goal here is to promote overall
health, and if you’re adding undue stress to your days, it’s not really worth it in
the long run. Instead of running, these individuals are invited to try bicycling,
trail walking, road walking, roller blading, or any other, less-intensive method of
getting outside and getting physical.
Change your diet
It can be the case that your diet keeps you from following through with
awakening. What vibration do the foods that you’re eating contain? Have you
ever thought to look? Sure, you’ve thought of calories, fats, carbs, and proteins,
but have you thought of the food’s actual vibration? If you’re trying to awaken
the source of subtle yet universal energy inside you, you’re going to need some
vibrationally powerful food. If you’re running into struggles with awakening that
either aren’t being resolved or that feel like they’re leading nowhere, try
switching up your diet. Trade out the processed foods for whole foods. Trade out
the meats for fruits and vegetables. Once you start eating better foods and
drinking better things, your cells will replenish themselves with the nutrients
from these healthier substances, which will lead to a better and healthier overall
expression of you! It might sound far-fetched, but food has energy just like
crystals and herbs do, even more so. When you eat that food, you take on its
energy, and if you eat death constantly, you will have a stagnant vibration. Raise
your vibration through your food, and kundalini will be riding those shakti,
world-shattering waves to awakening right along with you.
Spend time with nature & meditate there
Don’t forget the importance of going outside as you begin this life-changing
practice! There will be times when you feel low as you shed what doesn’t serve
you. There will be times when you feel so full of energy that you could burst.
There will be times when you feel like you’ve been walking in circles with
blinders on and just now realizing what’s been going on. Kundalini awakening is
a strange and bewildering time and having a solid routine for grounding can be
immensely helpful. Throughout your process, never forget the value of going
into nature. Nature is an endless reserve of subtle physical healing energies. It’s
also a wealth of signs that can help you communicate with your guides, your
higher self, and your intuition. The physical environment is alive beneath our
feet, and it can teach us more about ourselves (and our potential as humans) than
we might like to face, but its lessons are so, so, endlessly necessary to hear and
to learn. No matter what season it is for you or where you happen to live (city or
otherwise), get outside! Dress appropriately and go out to take in the season!
Meditate in nature whenever possible and let the visual symbolism of these
beautiful spaces guide you and your kundalini through any difficult work ahead.
Live a life of service or try volunteering
Are you really living from the heart? Or are you living from the head or the gut?
Are you maybe living from your groin instead? As you work through your
chakras’ blockages into kundalini awakening, you will be forced to find yourself
many, many times. You will see how your self-expression has been (and has not
been) aligned with your overall growth, and you will begin to notice the patterns
in your behaviors and personality traits. Eventually, you may even be made to
face your inadequacies in terms of love, self-expression, self-control, creativity,
survival, spirituality, psychic-ness, and more. The most intense inadequacy to
face, however (especially for those involved with kundalini awakening), is the
inability to love purely and selflessly. For those struggling with this heart chakra
blockage, “faking it until you make it” likely won’t work. You’ll need a physical
anchor for this love to connect with; otherwise, it will never feel genuine for
you. In that case, you might try volunteering or switching your job momentarily
to work in service of others. By putting yourself in a work-place situation of
service, you will be tested, and your abilities to love others selflessly will be
strengthened with each breath you take. It could be that your experiences are
wholly positive, but it very well may not. Take heart, however, for those harsh
experiences are the greatest teachers of all. In time, you will notice how your
heart is like a flower that blossoms with every new interaction. You’ll know
your kundalini’s awakening when what used to cause you the most bitter
irritation now evokes nothing but love.
Boost your practice with other subtle energy-healing
techniques
While kundalini awakening clearly connects you with realms of subtle energy in
your life, it can also be greatly boosted by the presence of other subtle energyhealing modalities aside from just using healing crystals or being around
physical nature. Moreover, of course, once you come to know more and more
about subtle energy-healing modalities, you can begin to pair them and combine
them generally as you see fit. The point is this: as you work through what helps
you and what doesn’t, you’ll realize that your intuition (aka, your connection to
your higher self and more) is stronger and more helpful than almost anything
else; you will draw to you the healing that you need, even if it just looks like
massage or a plant or a teeny pill that dissolves under your tongue. In that case,
your practice of kundalini awakening (or any awakening or ascension, generally)
should always be boosted by the application of other subtle energetic modalities,
as you see fit. A few options are as follows.
First, you could try using flower essences as a modality of subtle energy healing
that supports your kundalini awakening. Flower essences work based on the
extracted vibration of one type of flower at a time. Basically, you take (or buy
the product created by) a few buds of a particular flower and put them in a clear
bowl of water. Then, you set the bowl in the sunshine for 12 hours, either at once
or over time, as the sun wills. After that point, you remove the flower buds and
bottle the water with a drop or two of brandy as a preservative in each bottle.
Voila, you’ve got flower essences! Now, the fun begins. Just as each person,
each color, and each crystal has its own vibration, so does each flower. When the
essence of the flower is “extracted,” to a certain degree, in the flower essence,
you can then orally take the remedy (of a few drops of its liquid a few times a
day) and work to cure certain ailments that are attached to one’s aura or subtle
energetic expression. Flower essences can dissolve chakra blockages, too,
without you even realizing that’s what they’re doing. Look up flower essences,
for I promise, you’ll be fully amazed with the potential.
Second, you could seek out reiki healing in order to remove your chakras’
blockages and help the kundalini along. Reiki healing is a traditional Japanese
method of energy work that eliminates obstruction and blockage inside the
individual (emotionally, spiritually, intellectually, or otherwise) through the
applied insight and potential power of the practitioner. While reiki healing is
often paired with massage, it doesn’t have to be, for it’s really just about the
potential for the practitioner to dissolve energy blockages within the individual
from afar, through the application of the right energetic methods. Reiki healers
don’t even necessarily have to be next to you to heal you through their methods.
By connecting their own kundalini to shakti, to their spirit guides, and to the
earth, these individuals can receive guidance that blasts open your chakras from
states away, paving the way for the serpent to flow within you. Just be sure you
know what you’re getting yourself into before your first session!
Third, you could generally receive massages that aid in blockage release. With
or without the addition of reiki, massages are still an incredible thing. They feel
amazing (especially when performed by someone you trust), but they do more
than just make your skin and muscles feel good. Massages can also help you
become more aware of any blockages you might have (i.e., through where it
feels okay to be touched and where it doesn’t, through the places the masseuse
tends to linger on, through the pains you didn’t realize you had, and more) as
you work through that chakra opening and clearing process, making way for
kundalini. If you’re not comfortable with massage, try just getting a manicure or
a pedicure (Even if you’re a guy! Just be brave, schedule the appointment, and
own it!). The manicurist or pedicurist will absolutely massage your hands or
feet, respectively, and that smaller, focused massage will, through reflexology,
affect your overall bodily awareness (and potential for kundalini awakening),
too. In fact, any reflexology, acupuncture, or acupressure would be equally
helpful to this extent.
Fourth, you could still seek out therapy if you’re comfortable doing so. While it
doesn’t help all people, talking things out can still be immensely helpful for
some. Therapy doesn’t have to be completely about talk, either. Remember from
earlier in this chapter that therapy can be based around art, color, sound, and
music, too! If you think that you need to work through something in a bigger
way than just your insides can handle, don’t be ashamed. Turning to therapy
may potentially save your life. It might be daunting to know where to start or
how to make the first move. Try art or music therapy first if you can. If you can’t
afford a personal doctor, create your own therapies. Do whatever you need to in
order to get the toxicity out and somehow neutralized, and if that means that you
go to a “shrink” and talk things over, go for it. Kundalini (and your higher self)
will be thankful you did.
Fifth, you could try using essential oils or herbal healing to get things in gear.
These suggestions are correlated through their reliance on the vibrational
essences of plants and herbs. Through essential oils, the vibration is extracted
and contained in oil vehicles, while the herbs could also be made into “flower”
essences. Through herbal healing, as a whole, however, herbs are simply
appreciated for the subtle energies they contain and the healing they can impart.
Essential oils can vary in rarity and availability, but herbs themselves can
sometimes be extracted from your own backyard. If you’re in a rush these days,
however, you can always buy online. Make sure that you’re buying essential oils
that are perfectly in line with your goals, but you can also make things
purposefully ritualistic and low-tech. If you’d rather try the in-person, low-tech
method, go out in nature yourself and forage for plants with a guidebook. If
you’re drawn to a plant without knowing what it is, look it up and take notes.
You may find that your guides (or your intuition) have been leading you to the
ideal cure for so long without you even knowing it. Whether you use the
essential oil, the bought plant, or the foraged herb, kundalini will be grateful and
respond in kind.
Sixth, you could try decalcifying your pineal gland and reprogramming your
energy through sun gazing. Sun gazing requires you to be present for sunrise
and sunset each day. The gist is this: you stand barefoot in the rays of the sun as
it rises and sets, looking toward the sun, soaking in its life-giving energy, and
learning to feel full of its potential. Then, you tie this practice in with
intermittent or spontaneous fasting to get the whole experience of feeling
connected to the earth in completely new ways. Sun gazing supposedly has antiaging, anti-hunger, and anti-illness benefits that are almost unmatched by
modern medicine, and you’d better believe that sun gazing will affect
kundalini’s movement, too. Wake up with the sun and breathe in its rays deeply.
If you don’t feel kundalini stir up some shakti after just a week, I’ll be
completely flabbergasted.
Seventh and finally, you could try homeopathic remedies to work through
what’s causing those chakra blockages within you in the first place. While
modern medicine and pharmaceutical cures operate off of allopathic healing
(things different from the problem cure the problem) principles, subtle energy
cures lead us to investigate the older practice of homeopathy (like cures like)
instead. Homeopathy sometimes gets a bad reputation but is much more worth
one’s effort than you might imagine. Homeopathic remedies are constructed
from the vibrational essences of plants, minerals, and animals to the point of
mitigating the debilitating circumstances or illnesses. Instead of assuming, like
modern medicine does, that you can only heal something by administering a cure
devised separately, homeopathy assumes that poisons (in very small doses) can
actually heal greater ailments. It’s worth writing a whole book on the subject,
but for now, it will suffice to say that you should look into homeopathy if you’re
intrigued by this point. It could be that the trigger for your kundalini awakening
is a teeny homeopathy pill you’ll let dissolve under your tongue, and the greatest
thing is that if you take a homeopathic cure that your body doesn’t actually need,
it won’t do anything to you at all. Essentially, these wonderful subtle energetic
remedies only work if you need them. What are you waiting for? You’ll never
know how well these remedies can work until you do the research and try them
for yourself!
Take a dance class
Along the lines of the first point in this section, you might try taking a dance
class instead of taking up running. This decision would be much easier on your
knees, your lungs, and your muscles overall, but it could still be just as
worthwhile, if not more so. It just depends on your experience, your chakras, and
your goals with kundalini awakening. Overall, dance classes allow for physical
exercise aligned with your mental and meditative goals, but also provide an
outlet for creative expression that is likely not present for those who just choose
to run or work out or attend kundalini yoga classes. Therefore, attending dance
class would work incredibly well for people working through lower chakra
blockages (especially blockages in the sacral region). By connecting with music,
rhythm, movement, passion, ecstasy, bliss, and inspiration, people who choose
the dance class method will find release in the sacral and root chakras regardless.
Some people need this specific release more than others. If you’re stuck with
your root, sacral, or solar plexus chakras, don’t turn right toward running to be
your exercise mode of release (that’s better for crown, third eye, and throat
chakra blocked people, anyways). Instead, join a dance studio and take a weekly
class! Whether it’s shamanic dance, modern dance, hip hop, ballet, or otherwise,
just getting your body moving will inspire the kundalini, and every rhythmicallyplanned step you take will only serve to align your life more with your greatest,
most creative potential.
Chapter 4: Troubleshooting Your Awakening
While there are many positive signs and things that can go oh-so right with
kundalini awakening, it also happens to be the case that, sometimes, it doesn’t
work out like you’d think. Sometimes, it doesn’t seem like it’s even working out
at all. In those times, this chapter is here to help. We’ll troubleshoot three
different themes that could be affecting your process. First, we’ll consider what
might be holding you back. Second, we’ll look at the potential dangers and risks
that might be interfering with your process. Third and finally, we’ll examine the
most common mistakes people make in their awakening process, along with how
you can expertly avoid them. By the end of this chapter, you should have found
your personal slip-up, and you should be able to work at correcting it in no time.
12 Things That Could Be Holding You Back
There are so many things that could be paralyzing you on your journey. From
emotional struggles to physical ones or from going too fast to too slow, there are
various ways to accidentally get in your own way, but this section will help you
at least open your eyes and realize what you can do to help.
Physical challenges
The simple truth of the matter is that sometimes our bodies aren’t ready for
kundalini awakening quite yet. In some cases, it’s due to an auto-immune
disorder. Sometimes, it’s caused by a lack of ability in a certain part of the body.
Sometimes, still, it’s caused by the inability to practice meditation due to
extensive daily anxiety. Regardless of the physical challenges that are getting in
your way, you are not a failure. You will come to a point in your healing when
you will be able to handle kundalini awakening on top of everything else, but
right now might not be that moment, and that’s okay. Rushing one’s kundalini
awakening can be detrimental sometimes, and it’s always best to just take it at a
pace that feels natural and non-stressful for your experience and needs.
Experiencing things with too much intensity or too
quickly
Sometimes, the chakras aren’t that blocked, and they’re relatively easy to open,
cleanse, and align. For people that have this experience, the kundalini awakening
process may happen much faster than it would for the standard, highly-blocked
individual. If this is the case for you, you’ll likely have an incredibly intense
experience right from the beginning, and it could even become too intense
because of the speed of transition. If you’re not rushing things and they’re still
advancing intensely and quicker than anticipated, try to meditate every other
day. Try to take a step back in your process and allow it to become calmer,
rescaled to anticipate what you can handle. You may also benefit immensely
from having a guide or guru. Some people do not do well with these types of
relationships in healing and awakening, but because you’re so highly sensitive, a
teacher or mentor–even just a listening supporter–may be just the thing.
Diet doesn’t support awakening
It may sound far-fetched to some (and I’d be willing to bet this “some” group of
people is comprised mostly of meat-eaters), but sometimes, your diet will get in
the way of your awakening. Saying that doesn’t mean you need to go right ahead
and cut out meat or dairy or gluten or sugar. It more so means that you may be
able to aid your awakening process if you make a few slight adjustments. You
can start by eating less processed food and more fruits and vegetables. If that’s
hard for you to do to start off, try beginning by eating one less meal with meat
each week. Simply start small and see how you feel; see how your body reacts.
If a positive response is evoked, make additional changes in accordance.
You’re focusing on the wrong body part
Some issues with kundalini awakening are rooted in the individual’s abilities to
focus, and these issues are easily adjusted with a switch of where one’s attention
goes when he or she meditates. For example, especially if you focus your energy
into your head (or into your third eye) when you close your eyes to meditate
(which most people do), you’ve found your problem right there. To instigate
kundalini awakening, you need to start off by focusing your energy into your
heart, belly, and gut. The kundalini needs a healthy environment to rise into, and
if you’re sending all that healthy attention to your third eye, you’ve skipped way
beyond that gut space that the kundalini meets first. Think of how the kundalini
will move and prepare your body accordingly. In essence, during your
meditations, breathe deep into your stomach for a while and see what changes
for you.
Your mentality ignores the body or vice versa
Based on where kundalini awakening came from–in the modern day, with Yogi
Bhajan and his practice of kundalini yoga–it makes sense that your practice of
awakening can’t just be mental in order to succeed. It has to be balanced with
physical efforts, as you’re able to complete them. The connection with yoga is
important here, for that practice can do a lot to aid in your kundalini’s
awakening. Mainly, kundalini yoga especially helps cleanse blockages in one’s
chakras through movement and body-focused breathing. In the same vein, one
cannot instigate full kundalini awakening through just the practice of yoga.
There has to be a balance between mind-based and body-based approaches in
your overall attempt. Otherwise, you will continue on in this state of internal
imbalance.
Poor or unsupportive mood
To a certain degree, kundalini awakening can help readjust mood and emotional
imbalances, but one has to get to that point first. It could be that those
heightened mood and emotional imbalances are what’s keeping you from any
clear direction in your hopes of awakening. Check your mindset! Check your
most common moods! If there’s any way you can begin to adjust those mindsets
and moods, you’re sure to see some difference in your kundalini practice in no
time. It may sound complicated, pushy, or difficult now, but if you can somehow
rise above any draining moods and emotions, you’ll see your kundalini rise in
kind.
Overwhelming urges for control
It is true that the purest kundalini awakenings happen with absolutely no effort
on behalf of the individual, but not all awakenings can happen like that.
However, there are many distractions blocking the divine that are basically
everywhere these days. Ultimately, there should be no ego-based forcing,
pushing, or controlling involved in one’s awakening. But this whole book still
helps its reader through techniques and tips to aid in his or her self-guided
awakening, so it really just comes down to finding a balance. If you’re
struggling with the process, try to establish a better balance between selfguidance and trying to do too much too quickly, then see what happens.
Past trauma or PTSD is too strong of a blockage
Sometimes, the traumas we bore witness to in the past (or that we’re currently
surviving) create blockages for us that become so entrenched and so
ubiquitously spread throughout our chakras that we become unable to guide
ourselves through our own awakenings. That’s not a good or bad thing; it’s
simply a fact of life. If you feel that this sentiment applies to you, don’t be put
off from kundalini awakening, for there is incredible and life-altering hope for
you. It just means that you might have to work through your traumas separately
first. Based on what you’ve experienced, it may be supportive to talk to someone
about that experience, whether it’s a friend, partner, guardian (on this plane or
another), or therapist. Use art therapy or music therapy if you’d rather not
interact with another person, you’d rather not share your trauma with someone
else, or you feel that you have no one else to share it with. Get that yuck out
somehow! Try to be creative or communicative about it, and your kundalini will
start rising in no time.
Unwillingness to face one’s true nature
Awakening can be a tricky process at times. It’s not always just positive signs
and good feelings and happiness. Sometimes, you’ll be made to face your flaws,
and the task will be this: change them or suffer no further kundalini movement.
It’s a tough situation, but it definitely means that some people falter in the
process of awakening because of these self-based reality checks. Furthermore, as
the kundalini rises initially through the throat, third eye, and crown chakras
(before it starts free-flowing through all the open chakras), the individual will
realize more and more how filled with divinity he or she is. For some, this
awareness is frightening or too much to handle. Some are simply unwilling to
embrace this potential. To off-set from this situation if you find you’re being
held back similarly, what you can do is to practice radical openness and
acceptance of yourself, divinity, and others.
No community of support
If you’ve ever heard someone say that kundalini awakening will take your
friends and family from you, you’ve probably just interacted with someone who
tried to talk about his or her awakening with those closest to him or her, but the
community couldn’t or wouldn’t support those efforts. This dismissal of
awakening doesn’t always happen, and even if it does happen to you in regard to
your close friends or family, don’t let yourself get too down in the mouth quite
yet! There are a few things you can do in this case. (1) Leave kundalini
awakening out of it where these people are involved because (2) as you continue
on your awakening journey, your powers of attraction will be stronger than ever.
With the right combination of hope and focus, you’ll surely draw to you the right
community of support in no time. (3) You can also keep trying with those
friends and family, just with different tactics the next time. (4) You could even
dismiss the idea of a supportive community entirely and build one yourself with
information. There are a plethora of apps you can download that will help boost
your awakening with supportive tips and advice, and for some people, this
information switch is enough to make up for what people around them lack.
No teacher or guide
While some people will be self-guided in their awakenings with no issue, others
do work much better toward that experience with a teacher or at least a mentor
helping and guiding their paths. If you feel lost and are desperately seeking a
teacher, my first recommendation is to seek out a yoga studio that teaches
kundalini yoga. Strike up a conversation with the teacher there and see what
blossoms from there. Alternatively, you could seek out kundalini chatrooms
online, or if you prefer things in person, you could go to your local metaphysical
store and ask around about meditation mentors. You never have to struggle
alone. Let kundalini guide your confidence to enable you to draw in the people
whose help you’ll need for growth.
Environments don’t support awakening
Whether it’s your home environment, your work environment, your economic
environment, your natural environment, or otherwise, it is true that some spaces
do not align with one’s striving toward awakening. Sometimes, people talk trash,
which can affect your flow. Sometimes, people might laugh at you for what
you’re passionate about. Other times, you might be surrounded with pollutants
that keep, for example, your pineal gland calcified without your knowing. Trust
your intuition here. If it feels like an unsafe place to meditate or do your yoga
practice, try to find another space. If it feels like your well-being and sanity is
threatened by being who you are and doing what you want to do, seek shelter
elsewhere for this venture until you’re strong enough to fight that vibe. You
don’t have to force this process, and you certainly don’t have to do it where
you’re unable to feel safe.
10 Dangers & Risks Associated with Awakening
While “danger” is a strong word to describe it, truly, there are some dangers
associated with awakening, particularly in terms of going for more than you can
handle. This section will explicitly list 10 risks so that you can check whether
you’re approaching things in a way that’s more dangerous than necessary. If you
relate to any of these 10 points, you will definitely have to change your approach
if you ever hope to see true and lasting success with kundalini awakening.
However, some of these “dangers” are just symptoms that might scare you when
you experience them, and the point is just to work through them. I’ll note when
this case is true for a particular sentiment.
Overburdening or overwhelming the soul
There’s always the risk of spiritually overexerting yourself. Any time one forces
or tries to kick-start kundalini awakening, this risk is very present. Especially, if
you’re not in touch with your higher self or spirit guides, you may have an
extremely hard time realizing where your chakras are blocked and how exactly
to clear them. Furthermore, you may not realize until too late if you’re
overwhelming the kundalini and awakening process as a whole, forcing your
soul to handle more than what it’s ready for. The best tactic is to just take things
as they come without trying to do too much at once.
Doing things too much and too quickly
There’s equal risk for those who try to do too much and too quickly. This tactic
almost certainly causes imbalance later, as the forced and quickened kundalini is
made to rampage through your system’s vibration and somewhat ignore
blockages in the chakras it passes through. This action, on the whole, damages
one’s kundalini and creates addition states of disease in one’s chakras, so please
take me seriously here. Be careful not to do too much too quickly so that you
won’t have even more stuff to work through later on when you’re ready to try
again.
Your body can’t keep up with the mind
Sometimes, you won’t really know you’re doing too much and too quickly
because it’s all happening on the inside. In these cases, it’s likely that your body
can’t keep up with the speed that your mind can handle. Like the point just
above, this issue can mean future chakra imbalances and damages to your aura
and kundalini, so the best thing to do in response is to make sure that your
practice applies a combination of body-based and mind-based practices.
Meditating and chanting is one thing, but it can’t be just this expression without
yoga and even running or cycling, too. Align your body with your mind, and you
will not have this issue.
Lack of groundedness due to spiritual “highs”
As you work through and into the depths of your awakening, you may find
yourself spiritually “high” at times, and you will be much less grounded in your
earthen body whenever this comes to pass. This “danger” is more like a
symptom, as mentioned in the introduction paragraph to this section. Most
people will experience this groundlessness through the excitement of the
kundalini awakening. Your higher chakras will be opened wide, and you will
stand the chance to be distracted by what you can perceive now. Whenever
you’re feeling like this–dreamy, distracted, floaty, almost cloud-like–start
breathing deeply. Make one hand into a fist at your navel and imagine that you
can drop a cord from this spot in your body straight down into the earth. As this
cord drops and connects with nature, feel grounded and affirmed with your
human body. This visualization should ease such “high” symptoms whenever
they come up.
Jerkiness & muscle spasms
As with the point directly above, jerkiness and muscle spasms are symptoms of
kundalini awakening that many (if not all) will experience in their processes. It
only becomes coded as a “risk” or “danger” because the individual might not
think that these actions are connected to his or her awakening and get scared for
his or her own well-being. If ever you do have these spasms or involuntary jerks,
breathe deeply and try to feel at ease. These are natural “growing pains”
associated with awakening, and they will pass. Eventually, you won’t have them
at all anymore, but for now, breathe deeply and accept them. They’re a good
sign, believe it or not.
Finding yourself alone in the “dark night of the soul”
Another symptom of awakening is the experience of the “dark night of the soul.”
This period of time will come to pass for any involved in kundalini awakening,
and it’s not necessarily a fun time, which is why it’s coded as a “danger” or
“risk.” Essentially, the “dark night of the soul” is when you feel like you’ve hit
you’re lowest low. It’s the moment after you face all the flaws in yourself and
realize you can only move upwards, which is a daunting responsibility. You may
lose someone close to you, like a mentor, friend, or loved one. You may find
yourself feeling directionless or questioning everything you thought you knew
was true and real and good. If you find yourself feeling these things, you haven’t
failed at awakening yourself; know that to the depths of your core. You have not
failed; you’re right on track. For those who know someone very emotionally
sensitive who’s trying kundalini awakening, keep close tabs on that person. The
emotionally sensitive among us stand great risk when going through these
periods alone. If they’re too directionless and dejected, it can mean their lives,
but we can always protect against that. We are stronger as a community together,
and each of us will make it through this dark night with that backing strength.
Trouble adjusting to new worldview
When you go into awakening, you may not realize all that has to change. Your
relationship with popular culture, music, news, media, medicine, and more will
absolutely and undoubtedly change. A symptom of these adjustments that
sometimes poses as a “risk” or “danger” is that people can have trouble coming
to terms with the new worldview. If you relate to this message, try not to fight
what you’re learning. Practice open and radical acceptance and remember that
you would not be shown these things if it wasn’t necessary for your soul and
your kundalini awakening. Trust in the universe and believe profoundly that the
world is still beautiful without what you thought you knew.
Reworking & resolving trauma (potentially alone)
One symptom that gets coded as a “risk” or “danger” is that anyone who’s
experienced any level of trauma will be guided to work through those wounds
and scars when they begin with their kundalini’s awakening. So many traumas
find their root in one’s base chakra, and the kundalini rests there, right at the
base of the spine, behind the genitals and reproductive organs. When it starts to
rise, it will force the individual to process those blockages and resolve them,
which can mean a lot of intimidating (or even triggering) work. Try not to isolate
yourself during this process. You don’t have to feel alone when you’re working
on such intense resolutions, but the key may be in becoming brave enough to ask
for help.
Ignoring one’s transformative responsibility with
drugs
It may seem absolutely reasonable to combine, say, psychedelic drugs with
kundalini awakening. If it’s within your means, you might even be drawn to an
ayahuasca ceremony or excessive marijuana smoking. Think about it, though.
The kundalini is working to move through all your chakras in their most clear
expression, with no blockages and no numbness. Surely, it’s possible that drugs
can open your mind, but don’t forget that sometimes that openness comes at the
closing of something else. Your third eye might open, for example, but your
solar plexus chakra will absolutely shut down for a moment or even a few days.
Keep things on the inside on an even keel by using drugs as little as you possibly
can during your kundalini’s awakening. If you find yourself unable to stop, it
could be that addiction is what stands in your way more than anything else.
Developing kundalini syndrome
Kundalini syndrome is the reason why kundalini awakening sometimes gets a
bad reputation. Essentially, all these “dangers” and “risks” can pile themselves
together into a syndrome of unpleasantness for certain awakening practitioners
who are highly sensitive, already unbalanced, unusually easy to awaken, or
otherwise. Kundalini syndrome looks like constant jitters and anxiety with socalled “delusions of grandeur”. People with the syndrome live mostly in their
heads and have trouble relating to the physical earth plane. These people are
stuck in a phase of awakening, and that stuck-ness could have been caused by
forcing the process, speeding it up, or working through it for impure intention.
To avoid the syndrome for yourself, take things as they come with your
awakening and don’t get too stressed out when things get tough. Believe with
your heart that you will find balance and ease once more. You will make it to the
other side of awakening, and then, with that belief planted deep in your heart,
you’re sure not to get stuck.
15 Biggest Mistakes People Have Made (and How to
Avoid Them)
Since the onset of contemporary kundalini work in the 1960s, multiple people
have gone through the process, which means that many people have succeeded
in achieving awakening and that some people have absolutely floundered. These
people’s mistakes will be like spiritual gold for you, for they’ll help you learn,
correct your path, and adjust before the detrimental mistake is made. Though
some have fallen, their efforts will lift you up, and you will surely rise through
those efforts combined with your own.
Falling into the “goodness” ego trap
If you find yourself beginning to compare yourself with others on a basis of
what’s good and what’s bad, despite having your kundalini in a state of
awakening, you have fallen into an ego trap. The first step to correct this mental
blockage is to realize what you’re doing. A truly awakened person will not judge
others in this way. Notice what you’re doing and work directly against it.
Rethink the concepts of good and bad in their entirety and start looking for their
reflection deep within yourself before you go out into the world projecting them
onto others.
Falling into the “spiritual” ego trap
If you find yourself beginning to compare yourself with others on a basis of
who’s more spiritual than who, you’ve fallen into another ego trap. By judging
others in any aspect, much less degrees of spirituality, you put your ego in a
position where it’s more important and louder than your soul. True spirituality
finds a balance of ego and soul, if not a muting of ego to benefit soul, so if you
find yourself thinking these things or following these trains of logic, stop
yourself right there and correct it. The more you’re conscious of doing
(judgment-wise), the easier it will be to stop making such assumptions and
growing as a truly spiritual being.
Falling into the “love & light” ego trap
If you find yourself beginning to compare yourself with other awakened others
on a basis of who expresses the purest love vibration, you’re putting yourself
into another ego-trapping position. Not every spiritual expression involves “love
and light” at the end and not every one should. In fact, darkness and shadow are
as important forces in the universe as love and light are, so focusing on these
latter concepts would just create energetic imbalance. Lose the judgment and
remember how important balance is in all things.
Falling into insincere niceness
As you proceed down the path of awakening, people will become drawn to you.
You will experience an increase in natural charisma, and when people come to
you, they will expect help and guidance. Unfortunately, that means it will
become abundantly clear for others when you’re being insincere. Therefore, do
whatever you can in the coming weeks, months, and years to only express
niceness when you really believe it and mean it. Insincere niceness will turn
people off from you at every turn until it’s transmuted into something more
productive. If you notice yourself falling into this emotional rut, you’ll need a
jolt of something to reset yourself emotionally before real progress can be made.
Falling into judgmental comparisons
Whether it is based on goodness, spirituality, lightness, or anything else you can
come up with, any judgmental comparison you make will be proof of a big
mistake in play for you. Judgment is not a part of ascension, and it will find its
death in a true awakening process. As you move deep into awakening, take note
of your patterns of thought. Start to notice when your thoughts, emotions, or
statements involve judgment and redirect those things before they’re vocalized
into the world. Change your language, change your thoughts; change your
thoughts, change your world.
Giving up too soon
The most common mistake for kundalini awakening is to try for a few days then
give up because nothing is happening. I promise, something’s happening! It’s
just only beginning, and those first wiggles of the kundalini won’t feel like
anything for a while. It will (and should) take a good bit of time to fully achieve
awakening. Awakening should not be forced or pushed; it should not take a few
days. It should not even take a few weeks. In all honesty, it can even take longer
than a few months or a few years as it should, for the kundalini awakening
process requires a lot of respect and responsibility on behalf of the individual.
Sometimes, the personality needs a little work before it’s able to devote such
energy to such a powerful development. If you’re feeling impatient and want to
give up, keep going about it the way you have been. Don’t give up, for the
outcome will be well worth the effort.
Rushing or forcing the process
Numerous pieces of advice in this chapter warn of the dangers of rushing your
awakening process. Please, please, please: do not force yourself open. Allow
patience and proper timing to be instilled in your process. Allow yourself to
understand the importance of proper timing. Remember, too, that what you may
be pushing for so intently might not be as glorious as you think. Awakening
requires the shedding of layers, the transformation of unproductive to good, and
the loss of what’s been toxic. It’s not necessarily easy or glamorous, and it
should absolutely not be rushed into. To avoid this mistake, take things easy and
remember what awakening is really all about.
Losing discipline through the process
While kundalini awakening should not be rushed, its practices should at least be
constant in order for the best outcome to be achieved with the least harshness of
transition. Make sure that you don’t fall into the mistake of losing discipline
throughout the process. So many people start strong and dedicated and lose their
verve after a week. Instead of falling into the same rut, try to be conscious of
what’s happening with your energy level over time and plan accordingly with
your awakening. Plan your meditation and yoga periods during the times that
you know will work with your waking and sleeping schedule. Overall, make the
practice of maintaining discipline as effortless and natural as possible.
Spending less time (or no time) with nature
One of the more common mistakes involved with kundalini awakening deals
with one’s mindset and setting, as if one was going on a psychedelic trip. Your
mindset has to be right, but so does your environment, and in this case,
“environment” actually means the natural world. Make sure that you spend time
with nature weekly during your process of awakening. Without that
environmental boost, your awakening may become lopsided toward the benefit
of humanity over the earth, and as always, balance is key. Nature will inspire
you, center you, ground you, and teach you, and the kundalini is a snake after
all! Get in nature; I promise that it will make everything so much more
manageable.
Looking at spirituality as the end-goal or destination
One other common mistake is the view of spirituality or kundalini awakening as
if it was the end-goal in and of itself. I’ve been trying to shape my language in
this text to reflect that spirituality and kundalini awakening are not like some
mountain peaks that we can climb to and conquer. They’re so much more like
oceans or abysses to climb into and explore for eternity. While there are
certainly goals within kundalini awakening that you’re working towards, the
ultimate goal in the process is to realize that it’s exactly what it all is: process,
practice, and experience. By shifting how you look at things and how you talk
about awakening, you can make sure you don’t fall into the pitfalls of this
mistake.
Using the process simply to get psychic powers
Similar to the previous point, this one insists that your end-goal should not just
be psychic awakening and that’s it. If you’re going into kundalini awakening
with any goals other than to experience all the facets of divinity and spirituality
in yourself and the world, then your intentions are “impure,” and whether you
like it or not, your kundalini can sense that. In this case, your awakening may
end up becoming problematic or strife-ridden, but there’s a sure-fire way to
avoid this mishap. Don’t go into awakening just to get psychic powers or even
just physical healing. Consider the whole experience and devote yourself to the
blossoming of your true potential, no matter what that means for your body. It’s
just a shift in focus and then things can be back on the right track.
Looking for answers primarily outside one’s self
As you go through the process of awakening, a big mistake to fall into is that
you might accidentally create a routine where you constantly look outside
yourself for answers, forgetting your own intuition. Kundalini awakening is
about connecting yourself to the bigger sense of you, whether manifested
through your higher self, the communities you’re engaged with, your spirit
guides, your family, your soul mission, or otherwise. Therefore, if you find
yourself looking for answers only outside of you, you’re liable to reach
imbalance in the process. Remember to look deep inside and try not to shy away
from things you might not like in yourself. Processing all those kinks will be part
of what helps you through awakening out to the other side.
Getting overly attached to spiritual practice
While your practice of kundalini awakening is certainly important and will
surely become important to you, try not to get too attached to your routines, even
the ones oriented towards growth. The more attached you get to anything, the
more you stand to suffer, and kundalini, spirit, or divinity might just try to test
you by taking away the effectiveness of your practice just to shake things up. If
that happens, it’s just to get you to remember that spiritual development can
happen without any practice or routine whatsoever. It just so happens that
practice can help, but it is not everything. To avoid this problematic attachment,
therefore, switch it up often and don’t let yourself get too connected to any one
method. Stay flexible, stay open to all the experience awakening has to offer,
and remember: awakening is not something you can have, own, or possess; it’s a
practice, and you should never fully control that.
Using the process simply to contact the dead
Some people approach kundalini awakening with a specific end-goal in mind: to
contact the dead. While this type of awakening has the power to connect you
with planes outside and around earth and dimensions that are beyond ours, you
should never practice awakening just to have this experience. Like with several
points above, this end-goal makes your practice impure and will end up affecting
future imbalance in your health, chakras, and intellect. You can easily avoid this
mistake by making sure not to focus your awakening around just one facet,
especially this one.
Using the process hoping to be set free
Finally, it can be the case that kundalini awakening helps the individual feel free
– freer than he or she has ever felt before, more liberated to be him or herself,
and more able to do exactly what spirit calls him or her to do. However, as with
the point above, the end-goal of your process should not be this freedom.
Instead, allow freedom to be a happy symptom or side effect if (and when) it
arises, but don’t let your focus fall on it completely. Be there for the experience
and let what happens happen. Let go of control, expectations, and attachments,
and the kundalini shall surely rise.
Chapter 5: Kundalini Master’s Class
Now that you’re basically a master on kundalini and its awakening symptoms
and process, it’s time to advance you to the Kundalini Master’s Class! In this
chapter, you’ll be introduced to the juiciest tidbits of potential tied up in
kundalini awakening, from chakra alignment to astral projection and additional
psychic gifts. The challenge in approaching this chapter is to maintain a pure
reason for attempting awakening in your own life. Don’t get caught up in pride
and ego desires but just read this chapter and become aware of what’s in your
future if you follow this path. Simply read, accept, and trust what’s to come.
Chakra Healing & Alignment
With the knowledge of what each chakra does and what chakra blockages mean
in reference to your overall goal of awakening, you should now be able to take
things a step further in reference to your own chakra healing. The following is a
guided meditation for chakra alignment that you can read along to (or record
yourself reading aloud and play back as you go) and try out. Essentially, we’ll
walk through one method for aligning your open chakras and inviting the serpent
to rise.
Close your eyes and breathe deeply. Imagine that you’re on a beach by a cool,
clear lake. Picture the surroundings of this tranquil place, where you’re alone
with maybe a lake house behind you that feels like it’s yours. Knowing that
you’re in a beautiful yet safe and secure space makes you feel utterly relaxed,
strong, and at peace.
Suddenly, you realize that you’re not on the beach – you’re actually sitting in the
lake and the water comes up to mid-chest level. You feel completely content
with this decision, as the water feels somewhat warm and comforting in the
summer breeze. You close your eyes in the meditation as well as in the real
world.
If you cared to open your eyes, you’d see that the water is in fact so clear that it
almost looks like there’s nothing there. You’d see that it almost looks like you’re
just sitting on a ground of colorful gravel, but when you move your arms, you
know better. When you move, you can see (and feel) the ripples.
In this clear and calm lake, you sit. As you find peace in being there and trust
that nothing will harm you, you relax in a way that you haven’t been able to do
in a long time. You allow yourself to breathe deeply and roll your shoulders
down to release any tension there. You roll your head from side to side to release
strain in that area, too. Eventually, you bring your neck and chest to center and
you start to visualize your central channel.
In this inner column of energy, you visualize a free-flowing wave of white light.
You have the sense that the white light is flowing so strongly and purely that it’s
turning the water around you white, too. You peep open an eye and confirm your
intuition. The water you’re sitting in is still the same temperature and texture,
but it now looks like a bath of milk. You breathe in that purifying feeling and
close your eyes once more.
Remembering that free-flowing column of white light, you take your
visualization back to that space. Knowing that your chakras’ blockages have all
been cleared helps you feel confident moving forward, and you allow yourself to
get all but mesmerized with the beauty of that inner white light. However, the
light cannot last, and you know that this channel, this powerful column, can be
used for something even more important than just centering you in this moment.
In this calming, milky lake in the middle of your safe, secure space, you begin to
hum bravely. You don’t really know the song you’re humming, and it might just
be one tone hummed with the sound “ohm.” Whatever the song is, it’s been with
you always, and it’s a supportive song that feels right for this moment. As you
hum your song, it’s like you’re charming a snake, for kundalini seems to love the
sound.
Sure enough, the small snake that lies coiled up at the base of your spine starts to
move up, uncoiling and winding through your chakra energy wheels in search of
the source of the sound. Normally, you might be afraid of the image of a snake
within you but knowing that your body is rooted in this natural, imaginative
space somehow protects you and shields you from any harm. You trust this fact
and know it in your heart to be true.
Unafraid and excited, you hum more and more while kundalini rises and winds
through the root chakra to the sacral, around the solar plexus, and then up to
heart and throat. You notice that the serpent stays a while around throat chakra,
and you assume that it’s because kundalini enjoys the sound of your humming so
much. Ultimately, kundalini knows it must continue, so in the peace of your
body (resting in the peace of the lake, homed in the peace of this still, safe
space), kundalini rises once more.
Kundalini comes up into your face to lick the third eye and crown chakras before
turning and coming right back down through all the same chakras once more,
down through third eye to throat, heart, solar plexus, sacral, and root. As the first
cycle of serpent’s winding is completed, you feel filled with potential, and you
sigh with relief. You seem to feel that everything is right in the world and that
your direction is being revealed to you as you draw this very breath.
In the cool, completely clear water, you open your eyes and see that the world
has become so much brighter, sounds are clearer, smells are crisper, and the
water feels lighter than air. You stand and reach out your arms to the world of
this space and simply breathe in its beauty, knowing that you are full of the same
exact potential, the same prana and shakti inspiring both you and nature. You
breathe deeply and open your eyes to the world.
Reaching Higher Planes of Consciousness
If you have goals of accessing higher planes of consciousness, kundalini
awakening is a great place to start. In fact, kundalini awakening itself instigates
awareness of these higher planes, and some people even gain access to them, but
it always helps to have a guide at your disposal. For those interested in reaching
these states of consciousness with the help of eager kundalini, the following
section provides the guide that you need. The following 8 steps will lead you to
the access you seek, when performed for the right reasons.
First, clear your mind completely. Before you embark on the journey to other
planes of consciousness, you’ll need to make sure that you don’t bring any
unnecessary emotional baggage with you, so check it at the door! Close your
eyes and breathe into a meditative focus. Try to eliminate as many thoughts as
possible from your mind; let them dissolve like salt in water or like snow on hot
pavement. Let them evaporate from your mind until a still and calm inner space
is achieved. This still space is absolutely essential to attain moving forward, so
you’ll want to ensure it’s a strong one. Hold this space in mind for as long as
possible before even moving onto the second step.
Second, evoke the central channel. Meditatively shift your consciousness now to
see this central channel illuminated within you as best as possible. If you’re still
working through any recent blockages, you might see those as darker spots in the
channel, but hopefully, no spots exist whatsoever. As you visualize this central
channel, fill it with that same bright white light as the last section and imagine
that you can add love to that light energy. Love is a vibration you’ll want to
carry with you as you journey into other realms, for it is part of what’s so unique
about being human. If you ever get lost, you can always follow that vibration
back to where you came from, but that matters later. For now, just focus on
breathing and boosting that central channel with as much love and light as
possible.
Third, allow the serpent to rise. Once it’s comfortable to do so and once it knows
the channel is ready, kundalini will come out to play. At this point, you can
meditatively visualize kundalini following its winding path through your chakras
once more, up from the base to the crown and back down again. See how many
slow and steady cycles you can withstand witnessing before you are pushed into
action. Simply watch the serpent complete its inner course and trust in its
energetic potential for you. Express love to kundalini and trust in the universe
and then follow the next step.
Fourth, accept and express gratitude for your body, and don’t let yourself forget
about what your physical body does for you even on a daily basis! It’s a source
of great strength and support, and it will remain solid and secure on the earth
plane while your consciousness and soul explore others. Breathe in that truth and
breathe out your trust. Additionally, express a powerful wave of acceptance and
love for your body. Feel grateful for all that it does for you and be proud of what
you’ve accomplished with it! Whether your past life experiences come to mind
or your conquering of chakra blockages to allow for kundalini awakening does
instead, simply remember all your body has done for you and be proud! Know
that future experiences with this earthen form will absolutely benefit your
growth.
Fifth, check your goals against your higher self. You must have come to this
experience in search of higher planes of consciousness for a reason, and that
reason might not be backed by the purest of intentions. Try to be as honest with
yourself as possible as you search to define the real reason why you want this
type of access to other planes of consciousness. Once you’ve divined the answer,
check it against your higher self. Some people ask this question in the form of,
“WWJD? What would Jesus do?” You’ll ask it in terms of, “What would my
best self do?” Use that insight to inform your experience as you likely decide to
move forward.
Sixth, state the goal you have in mind to kundalini. Once you’ve checked and
altered those goals based on your interactions with your higher self, you should
also check to make sure that your kundalini can handle such cosmic connectivity
right now. Check in with kundalini again and make sure it’s not overburdened,
exhausted, or that it got accidentally rerouted from its path winding through the
central channel. As long as kundalini is operating normally, then things should
be good to go! Don’t push things, however. It sure sounds fun to visit higher
planes of consciousness, but if shakti isn’t there with you somehow because you
jumped the gun with kundalini’s readiness, you’ll surely regret it, for the
experience will be nowhere near what you imagined.
Seventh, let kundalini take you there. As kundalini expresses its approval of your
goals, let go of the reins and let kundalini take control. Trust that this vehicle of
source energy will get you where you need to be, and feel the company of your
angels and guardians, too, for they’ll surely be able to make this trans-plane
journey with you.
Eighth, make sure that you’ve developed a tactic to return. Accessing higher
planes of consciousness (and other planes of existence) can be an experience
similar to astral projection and travel at times, and you’ll have to remember
where you came from so you know where to return to. You won’t want your
consciousness floating out in the ether for anyone to imprint on or get interested
in. In order to ensure that doesn’t happen, make a return plan before you even
“leave” for the higher plane. If you’ve seen the film Inception, take a note from
their book and bring a “token” with you that will remind you which world is
real. It might sound crazy, but the more awakened you and your kundalini
become, the more immersive meditation experiences of this nature you’ll have
for yourself.
Astral Projection & Travel
Different from travelling to higher planes of consciousness with kundalini’s
help, you can also astrally project and travel with the same type of aid. When
going to other planes of consciousness, the soul and mind go to another level of
thought that impacts the body in ways standard words or knowledge would never
be able to do. But when using astral travel, one can actually go to other
dimensions, realities, worlds, and more. This section will serve as a guide for
those who seek to develop abilities of astral projection and travel, for these gifts
are more complicated than they may seem at first.
First, clear your mind completely in a meditative state. Let your mind become
clear of thoughts and emotions. Let any urges, desires, needs, or calculations exit
your mind as well. The goal is to have calm, serene silence within the mind.
Before you travel to other energetic planes, you need to make sure that you’re as
pure of an energetic expression as possible. You don’t want to end up going out
into these other planes with energetic blockages that keep you from coming
home just because of one thought that stuck out before you left! Try to eliminate
that possibility from happening by maintaining this calm, composed mind before
moving any further in the process.
Second, evoke the central channel and raise the kundalini. With your calm and
collected mind, remember that central channel. Let it become illuminated with
the same warm white light and then allow kundalini to feel invited to rise.
Without any blockages in its way, the serpent cautiously yet comfortably winds
and winds to your crown chakra and then back down again.
Third, allow yourself and the kundalini to meld together in a hypnotic state.
With kundalini flowing through your chakras and activating the central channel,
close your eyes and try to visualize what’s happening in detail on the inside.
Watch kundalini methodically rise and fall. Feel supported by those efforts but
also allow those conscious thoughts and emotions to fade away once more. You
want to get hypnotized by this motion; get lost in it! All that matters is that you
and kundalini are one, and its motion within you begins to create a vibration that
pronounces: I’m ready for travel.
Fourth, remember that your mind has so much more power than your body.
Before you embark on the astral voyage, you’ll want to partially ground yourself
with this knowledge, and the best way to do so is to “ground” yourself (so to
speak) in the astral body. With those eyes closed and your mind in this
hypnotized state, begin to connect with the body that’s not yours. What I mean is
this: when you visualize squeezing your fist, it’s not your actual body that
moves, but you are imagining a body that’s yours (that’s not actually your
physical body) doing the work. In this sense, I want you to connect with the
version of your body that exists in the mental realm and that’s affected when you
visualize things. Try to move each finger and toe of that imagined body
separately. Create several other exercises for yourself to root with this astral
body, and your trans-plane journey will become all the easier. A few other things
you can try are imagining doing jumping jacks, doing a cartwheel, counting on
your fingers, juggling, and doing an intricate dance.
Fifth, connect to your subtle energy. You’ve worked to connect with your
physical body, you’ve done the same and connected with kundalini, and you’re
connected with your astral body, but what about what’s left? There’s always an
additional layer of subtle energy vibrating all around you due to the other
carbon-based life-forms (and technological devices) in our world. Try to get in
touch with that energy layer now. With your still-partially-hypnotized mind and
your openness to the whole experience, allow yourself to feel a buzzing at the
edge of your being as your astral body begins to separate from your physical
body. This buzzing or vibrating is a good sign. It says that things are going
exactly the way they should. Not everyone feels these vibrations before astral
projection, however.
Sixth, let visualization take control. With your eyes closed, start to see your body
as if you were floating above it looking down. Let your soul, essentially, become
elevated and weightless as it rises above your own body. Like the rising
kundalini, your soul floats up to its highest potential and back down, just starting
to explore the space around you. It wanders through your room and house but
does not get outside your home to start. There’s still a bit of safety-making and
grounding work to do before that final step into the ether can be achieved.
Seventh (and maybe most important!), always keep your root in mind! There
will be a silver cord that attaches your astral body to your physical body, and
that will sometimes be the only thing that can help you get back home. Don’t
forget to mind this physical and energetic root cord. As you have been exploring
your room or your home, did you notice that cord yet? If so, that’s wonderful! If
not, you may not be having a full, pure astrally projective experience quite yet,
but keep running with the visualization to see where it takes you!
Eighth, allow yourself to explore the astral plane you’ve found, with baby steps
first, of course. Now that you see your silver “grounding” or homing cord, go
ahead and see what’s around. Look around your neighborhood and maybe your
city. Stay on the earth plane at first so that you don’t get too overwhelmed.
Eventually, you can try to explore completely different planes, realities, and
dimensions, but your home density is always a safe and familiar place to start.
Clairvoyance & Other Psychic Gifts
If you approached kundalini awakening in the first place hoping for some level
of psychic awakening, don’t feel dejected or misled. Kundalini awakening will
absolutely align you better with your intuition, deeper insights, and soul’s
mission. Furthermore, it will allow you to unlock additional psychic gifts on
levels you may not have even known existed before your kundalini rose. This
section will walk you through several different psychic gifts that are possible to
attain, and as you strengthen your general manifestation and attraction abilities
with kundalini awakening, you may even be able to pick and choose these gifts
for your experience and needs, based on what you read below.
Astral projection is the psychic gift explored in the previous section, and it is
essentially the ability to explore other realms with your consciousness
voluntarily.
Aura reading is another psychic gift that is basically exactly what it sounds like.
Many of us have the gift of aura reading in our own way, and if anyone tries to
tell you that only one version of aura reading is right, they’re not telling you the
full truth. Everyone who can see auras sees them a little bit differently because
everyone is unique in their own way. Therefore, if you believe you can see
auras, but it doesn’t fit with others’ experiences, don’t worry; trust yourself and
believe in your gift.
Automatic writing is a psychic gift that involves channeling (the next point in
this list) to a certain extent. Essentially, this gift allows the writer to be able to
channel his or her higher self, guides, angels, guardians, or more in that person’s
effort to be verbally creative.
Channeling is a psychic gift that allows the individual to enter a trance and let
another spirit speak through them for a time. It’s sort of like demonic or angelic
possession, but it’s voluntary. The person who acts as the channel will almost
always be fully willing to let the spirit talk through him or her.
Clairaudience is a psychic gift that revolves around the ability to hear outside the
standard range of human hearing. People with these gifts would be able to hear
into other planes of existence, even into supernatural worlds.
Clairgustance is an unusual psychic gift that is oriented around taste and eating.
Individuals with this gift would randomly get a taste in their mouth and then
receive messages later on in relation to that taste. Furthermore, these “clear
tasters” would be able to taste something before even putting it on their tongue.
Clairsalliance is a psychic gift that revolves around the ability to smell outside
the standard range of human smelling. Perhaps you would smell something
before it happened (such as spilled food or a gas main break or fire). Perhaps you
would be able to smell someone’s vice on him or her before even striking up
conversation. The possibilities are virtually endless!
Clairsentience is the psychic gift that allows one to simply feel the presence of
something more. Whether that “more” is a spirit, a guide, an ancestor, a demon,
or what have you, this individual would sense the physical (or spiritual) energy
of that being before anyone else.
Clairvoyance is a more commonly-heard-of psychic gift that features the ability
to see information in one’s mind. These people might receive visions or see
physical insights into others’ lives, but the gist is the same each time: things are
always visual.
Divination is the general application of one’s psychic gifts to find answers to
questions. Divination can be used in terms of reading palms, tea leaves, I Ching,
natal charts, tarot cards, crystals, runes, and so much more.
Dowsing is a more old-school psychic gift that our ancestors used to find things.
Sometimes, dowsing is guided with a rod or sticks, but the point is to find what’s
important to you (it was often water or shelter) when you might even have no
idea what you’re looking for.
Empathy is a psychic gift that allows you to literally feel or take on the emotions
of another person. Empaths are often highly sensitive to the feelings of others to
a detrimental degree until they learn how to ground themselves and protect their
energy from all-too-natural invasion by others.
Intuition is an underrated psychic gift, for it truly is an example of precognition.
Anyone whose intuition was right essentially received a momentary glimpse into
the future, so the next time your intuition is right, be proud for you’re unlocking
psychic gifts as you live and breathe! There’s the first piece of proof!
Mediumship is the highly-coveted psychic ability of contacting those who have
passed. Many people are fascinated (if not obsessed) with communing with the
spirits of those who are no longer living, and kundalini awakening can help you
get there, but you’ll really want to be careful. Mediumship can be an incredibly
draining gift, and it’s not for the faint of heart. I guess what I’m saying is this: be
careful what you wish for.
Premonition is the psychic ability of being able to see into the future. This gift is
often more symbolic than literal, but the gist is the same whether the message is
literal or figurative: the individual with the gift of premonition will know of
future events before they come to pass.
Psychometry is a sense-based psychic gift that connects the individual with truth
or facts about an object, thing, animal, place, or person just by touching it.
Retrocognition is the psychic ability of being able to see into the past with
varying degrees of detail. Sometimes, those glimpses are into one’s past lives,
while other times, they’re general peeks into the past that have no relation to
your experience (as far as you know!).
Telekinesis is a psychic ability that allows the individual to manipulate matter
with his or her mind, whether moving it, energizing it, or otherwise. Telekinetic
individuals can sometimes do such amazing things as walk through walls, bend
firm objects, trash a room without being in it, call people to their aid without
speaking, and more.
Telepathy is the final psychic gift we’ll discuss, and it relates to the power of the
individual to communicate with others without opening one’s mouth. This
alternative mode of communication would likely be through thought, emotion, or
vibration.
Conclusion
As you approach this final page of Kundalini: The Ultimate Guide to Awakening
Your Chakras through Kundalini Yoga and Meditation and to Experiencing
Higher Consciousness, Clairvoyance, Astral Travel, Chakra Energy, and
Psychic Visions, another set of thanks is in order. Thank you for making it all the
way to this point! I hope that the experience you felt was worthwhile and that
you learned quite a lot in the process.
Now that you have this guide and all its information, the next step is to put your
plans in motion. You should have a good idea about whether or not you’re ready
to begin your kundalini awakening process at this point (or if it’s already
happened/happening to you!), and if so, you should have this so-called plan
partially drawn up.
Next, it’ll be time to start changing your routines to support your oncoming
awakening. It’ll be time to begin adjusting your attitude, trying out meditating,
meditating more often, or even just incorporating it into your daily process. With
a few simple switches, you will be surprised how quickly the effects start
making themselves known.
